<h1 class='c005'>Connie Carl at Rainbow Ranch</h1>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chI' class='c006'>CHAPTER I<br /> <br />A Homecoming for Connie</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll take your luggage now, Miss,” said the
colored porter politely. “We’ll be a-pullin’
into Red Gulch in five minutes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I know,” replied the girl softly, without
shifting her gaze from the window.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the past hour Connie Carl had been watching
the horizon beyond the flashing telegraph
poles. A faint cloud-like blue line which represented
New Mexico’s mountains—her mountains—had
steadily moved closer. She was going home
at last, home to Rainbow Ranch.</p>

<p class='c008'>At first glance a stranger never would have
taken Connie Carl for a Westerner. The girl was
neatly dressed in a blue suit with gray suede
slippers, and a wisp of auburn-red hair peeped
from beneath her jaunty felt hat. She looked for
all the world like a young lady who had just
graduated from a stylish Eastern finishing school,
which in truth, she had. But now, at sixteen,
Connie Carl had returned to the prairie land she
loved, to make her home once more at the place
of her birth, Rainbow Ranch.</p>

<p class='c008'>The train had slowed down for the station.
Connie went quickly down the aisle, waiting in
the vestibule until the train came to a full stop.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Someone meetin’ you, Miss?” asked the porter
as she slipped a coin into his hand. “This heah
Red Gulch ain’t nothin’ but a wide place in the
road.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I’ve wired ahead, so I’m sure someone
will meet me,” said Connie with a smile. “Anyway,
I’ve been here before.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The porter set out the luggage on the platform.
As the train pulled slowly away, Connie looked
quickly about.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two men in wide brimmed hats and blue overalls
were loading freight on a motor truck, but
she did not know either of them. Otherwise the
platform was deserted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s queer there’s no one here to meet me,”
thought Connie. “Perhaps I didn’t send my wire
in time for it to reach the ranch.”</p>

<p class='c008'>After hesitating a moment, the girl picked up
her heavy suitcases and carried them into the unswept
little station. She walked over to the ticket
window where the agent was busy with a report.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hello, Andy!” said Connie.</p>

<p class='c008'>The agent looked up and stared. Then light
broke over his face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, if it ain’t Connie Carl! I’m sure glad
to see you back.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m glad to get back home too, Andy. It
seems as if I’ve been gone half my life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s see, how long has it been?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Three years—three long years.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So they educated you, did they, Connie?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, they tried it,” laughed the girl, “but I’ve
not forgotten how to ride a horse. I can hardly
wait to get out to the ranch. I thought someone
would meet me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Haven’t seen Blakeman or any of the Rainbow
outfit in town for a week. Roads have been
pretty muddy. But you can get through now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll hire a rig,” said Connie. “Does old Charlie
Trench still rim his jitney?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Same as ever,” the agent agreed with a grin.
Then his face became sober. “But you may find
other changes around here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What sort of changes?” inquired Connie
quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, one thing and another,” answered the
agent vaguely. “Say, I see Charlie across the
street now. If you want to catch him you better
hurry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie hastened across the street, stopping the
old man just as he was entering a cafe. He
greeted her with a hearty handshake and declared
that he would be glad to drive her out to Rainbow
Ranch.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Everything looks just the same,” laughed
Connie as Charlie loaded her bags into the decrepit
old car.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe they look thet way,” replied the old
taxi driver shortly, “but they ain’t! You’ll find
plenty of changes, Connie—’specially out at
Rainbow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, is anything the matter, Charlie?” Connie
stared at him in surprise. “I thought everything
was running well. The foreman, Forest
Blakeman, seemed to be very efficient.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure, he’s efficient. ’Specially where his own
interests are concerned. You’ll find most of the
old outfit broken up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Isn’t Red Farnham there?” asked Connie in
amazement. “And Shorty and Sixshooter Pete?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Red left six months ago,” Charlie answered
with a shrug. “Sixshooter Pete drifted north this
spring, and some of the other boys hired out to the
Drowsy Water outfit. Shorty took himself to
Mexico. I reckon Lefty Forbes is about the only
one still there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why didn’t Blakeman write me about these
changes?” asked Connie indignantly. “Why,
those boys were my father’s most loyal cowhands.
Rainbow Ranch won’t seem like home without
them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s been a lot of changes since your Dad
died, Connie.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” agreed the girl soberly. “When he
willed Rainbow Ranch to me, he provided that I
must attend school in the East. I never wished
to leave New Mexico because I feel that I belong
here. Now that I’m through school, I’m aiming
to take over the management of Rainbow Ranch
myself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Old Charlie glanced sideways at the girl as he
steered the car along the narrow dirt road.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe that won’t be so easy to do, Connie,”
he said quietly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dad left Rainbow Ranch to me, didn’t he?”
the girl asked sharply. “What are you driving
at anyway, Charlie? I wish you’d speak right
out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve already talked a-plenty, Connie. You’ll
get the lay of the land soon enough.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Old Charlie lapsed into moody silence, devoting
all his attention to the road. For a time they
drove through a winding canyon, following the
bed of a swift-moving stream. On either side rose
red rock walls which under the light of the fading
sun took on many beautiful hues. By craning her
neck Connie could see the tops of spruce trees,
aspens and cottonwoods.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girl watched the blue mountains moving
closer and closer. She breathed deeply of the fresh,
crisp air. It was good to be home, and yet the
edge had been taken from her enjoyment.</p>

<p class='c008'>She felt disturbed. Both the station agent and
Old Charlie had hinted that she would find many
changes at Rainbow Ranch. She wondered if she
had trusted too much in the judgment of her foreman,
Forest Blakeman.</p>

<p class='c008'>Presently the car rolled over the crest of a high
hill. Connie leaned forward and glanced down
into the valley. She could see the rambling old
adobe buildings of Rainbow Ranch.</p>

<p class='c008'>The car crept down the hill, and came at last
to a huge wooden gateway. Old Charlie unfastened
it and they drove up a long lane to the
courtyard of the ranch house. A dog began to
bark.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Connie stepped from the car, she saw a tall,
dark-haired man striding toward her. It was the
ranch foreman, Forest Blakeman.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Howdy, Miss Connie,” he said heartily, sweeping
off his sombrero. “Welcome home to Rainbow
Ranch. I was just aimin’ to drive in to Red
Gulch myself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you did receive my telegram?” asked
Connie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, but a lot of work piled up on us this
afternoon, and I couldn’t get away as early as I
planned. We’re short handed you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Charlie was telling me that Shorty and Red
are gone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” nodded the foreman indifferently.
“Here, let me take your bags. You must be tired
after your long trip.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am,” Connie confessed wearily.</p>

<p class='c008'>She followed the foreman into the ranch house.
A feeling of relief came over her for inside the
dwelling very little had been changed. The adobe
walls, mellowed by the smoke of the fireplace,
were still adorned with her father’s Mexican
treasures. The furniture was all massive and
hand carved.</p>

<p class='c008'>A shy Mexican girl whom Connie had never
seen before in her trips to the ranch took her bags
and led her down a long tiled corridor to the east
bedchamber.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie unpacked her luggage and changed into
a fresh skirt and blouse. She was tired but she
felt too excited to lie down. She went to the
window and opened it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Below she could see the corrals and the barn,
and beyond, a long stretch of green meadow land.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish I had time for a canter before supper,”
Connie thought.</p>

<p class='c008'>She had forgotten to ask the foreman about
her favorite mount, Silvertail. Connie had raised
the big gray from a colt and he was the best horse
in the Rainbow string.</p>

<p class='c008'>Leaving the ranch house, the girl walked
rapidly toward the barn. But she stopped short
as she saw a familiar slouched figure leaning
against the corral bars.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Connie!” cried a gruff voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lefty Forbes!” laughed Connie, clasping his
horny hand in her own. “I’m glad to see one
familiar face around here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I reckon you won’t be seein’ mine much
longer,” drawled the cowboy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you mean?” asked Connie quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Blakeman is figurin’ on givin’ me my honorable
discharge if I kin read the signs,” replied the
cowboy dryly. “But I calculate to beat him to
the trigger. I’ll be quittin’ any day now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Lefty, you can’t! Why, I need you here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s the only reason I’ve stayed on, Connie,”
said the cowboy soberly. “I thought a lot
of your Dad, and this ranch. But there ain’t
nothin’ I can do now. Blakeman runs things with
a purty high hand.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s only the foreman, Lefty. Now that I’m
home, I mean to manage the ranch myself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I reckon you don’t know jest how bad things
are, Connie.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Blakeman wrote me the ranch had been losing
money the past year. Is that what you mean,
Lefty?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Things have been runnin’ down hill ever since
he took over, Connie. Blakeman’s handled the
ranch with a high hand. First he fired Pete and
Shorty——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He discharged them?” Connie gasped. “Why
I thought they left of their own accord——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, they didn’t. They didn’t see eye to eye
with Blakeman so he told ’em to go. ’Course you
know how the cattle market’s been the last few
years. An’ Blakeman seems to have a talent for
sellin’ at the bottom. Truth is, things are in a
purty bad way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I mean to have a talk with Blakeman tomorrow,”
Connie declared. “If he doesn’t wish to
handle the ranch as I say, I’ll find a new foreman.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can’t do that, Connie.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why can’t I? Isn’t this my ranch?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was your ranch,” said the cowboy quietly,
“but I reckon now that the First National Bank
has a strangle hold on it. They have a couple of
notes——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, Blakeman wrote me about that,” Connie
interrupted, “but I understood the debt was only
a small one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s enough so the bank can take over any time.
For the past year Blakeman has paid the interest
out of his own pocket—or so he claims. And
you’re owin’ him more than a year’s back salary.
So you see, unless you’re supplied with ready cash,
you can’t tell him to go.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I begin to understand,” murmured Connie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Blakeman is a slick sort of fellow, Connie.
You want to think your way and move slow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And with that bit of sage advice, Lefty Forbes
moved off toward the barn.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chII' class='c009'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br />The Coming Rodeo</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Connie was abroad at dawn the next morning.
Dressed in riding clothes, she let herself
out of the ranch house and went to the barn
where Silvertail was stabled.</p>

<p class='c008'>The big gray turned his head at her approach
and gave a low whinny of welcome. Connie
laughed with delight as she patted the mane on
his glossy neck.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You <i>did</i> miss me, Silvertail,” she said softly.
“And how lonesome I’ve been for you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She led the horse from the barn, and with a
quick, agile spring vaulted on his back. Connie
needed no saddle. She had learned to ride bareback
as a child, and when it came to handling a
high spirited horse there were few cowboys who
were her equal.</p>

<p class='c008'>Turning her mount eastward toward the rising
sun, the girl dug in her heels. Silvertail snorted
and the dust rolled from under his hoofs. The
rhythmic, regular beat of the steel shoes came as
music to Connie’s ears.</p>

<p class='c008'>Silvertail’s action, as always, seemed nothing
short of marvelous. He ran smoothly and easily,
obedient to the slightest touch of his mistress.
Connie rode him with body bent low, the wind
whipping her hair about her face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ve gone far enough,” she said at last,
turning back toward the ranch.</p>

<p class='c008'>As they came up to the corrals, Lefty Forbes
emerged from the bunkhouse. Connie slid to the
ground, her face flushed, her eyes bright with
excitement.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Lefty, Silvertail is marvelous!” she declared.
“In all the world there’s not a horse to
compare with him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nor a rider who stacks up with you,” replied
the cowboy affectionately. “I suppose you saw
the posters advertisin’ the rodeo.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No! When is it coming, Lefty?” Connie
asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Next week. Entries close Thursday night.
They’re offerin’ some good prizes this year. Five
hundred dollars for the best gal bronco rider. I
remember you won out in that event when you
were just a kid——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m afraid I was a better rider then than I am
now,” said Connie. “I’ve been out of practice for
three years.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can still ride circles around all the girls in
this county,” Lefty insisted loyally. “It might
be an easy way to pick up some money.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Or a few broken bones,” added Connie with a
laugh. “No, I think I’ll let someone else try for
that five hundred dollars.”</p>

<p class='c008'>After breakfast she asked Forest Blakeman if
she might have a talk with him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I reckon you can,” he replied with a frown.
“It’s time you learn just how matters are around
here. I hate to tell you, Miss Connie, but the old
Rainbow is headed for the rocks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You gave me no hint of it in your letters,” said
Connie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Didn’t see what good it would do to worry you.
We might have made it if the bottom hadn’t fallen
out of the cattle market. Lost a thousand dollars
on our last shipment.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My father always made money from this
ranch. It’s considered one of the best in New
Mexico.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Times have changed since your Dad was alive,
Miss Connie. Most of the smart ranchers have
gone into the Dude business.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then why can’t we do the same?” demanded
Connie. “The ranch house would hold at least a
dozen guests. If necessary we could build on an
extra wing and——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It takes money to make improvements, Miss
Connie.” The foreman spoke with a slight sneer
which was not lost upon the girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can’t we raise even a few hundred dollars?
That would be enough to get us started.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We can’t raise a dime—not a dime. Our
credit has been stretched to the limit. Fact is,
there’s a note coming due for fifteen hundred dollars
at the First National—that’s next month. If
you’re not able to meet it, I’m afraid you’re going
to lose the ranch, Miss Connie.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie stared at the foreman thoughtfully.
She had not realized that matters could be so bad.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You should have told me about it months ago,”
she murmured.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No one could have done a better job than I of
managing this ranch,” the foreman snapped.
“I’ve worked night and day at the job. I’ve even
advanced my own money to pay interest on the
ranch debts. My own salary hasn’t been paid
for months!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wasn’t blaming you,” Connie said quickly.
“I just wish you hadn’t kept these things from me.
What do you think is the best for us to do?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If the bank won’t renew your note you’re
through,” replied the foreman bluntly. “I can’t
advance any more of my own money.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I certainly don’t expect it of you,” said Connie
quietly. “Tomorrow I’ll drive in to town and see
the banker.”</p>

<p class='c008'>After Blakeman had gone to the barn, she sat
for a long while on the top rail of the high corral,
gazing toward the distant mountains. She felt
very alone and for the first time in her life, inadequate
to the situation.</p>

<p class='c008'>For some reason which she could not have explained,
she did not like Forest Blakeman. Nor
could she entirely trust him. He had badly mismanaged
the Rainbow Ranch, she believed, allowing
the quality of the stock to run down and the
buildings to deteriorate. But she could not discharge
him because she owed him money.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lefty is right,” Connie thought uncomfortably.
“I’ll have to move carefully.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The girl sat watching the horses which had been
herded into the smaller pens. A sorrel in particular
held her attention for only the night before
one of the cowboys had told her that the animal
was as yet unbroken.</p>

<p class='c008'>Presently Lefty and Alkali Pete came out of
the barn with a saddle. They grinned at Connie
as they stopped by the corral.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now you’ll see some fun,” said Lefty grimly.
“Old Firewater has a wicked look in his eye this
morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie watched with keen interest as Lefty’s
swinging rope started the sorrel to running in
wide circles around the corral. Then the lariat
flashed out, stopping the animal neatly.</p>

<p class='c008'>While the two cowboys were trying to get the
saddle on, the sorrel snorted and snapped his teeth
and fought at their slightest touch. Connie slid
down from the fence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lefty, let me ride Firewater,” she pleaded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not this baby, Connie,” said the cowboy.
“He’s thrown me twice.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Lefty, don’t be stubborn. You know I
can do it. Anyway, I’m not afraid to wipe up a
little corral dust. It won’t be the first time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Quit your teasin’,” muttered Lefty.</p>

<p class='c008'>But in the end he gave in, just as Connie knew
he would. When the sorrel was saddled, the cowboys
blindfolded him, and held his head between
them until Connie was mounted. Then the ropes
were released and the blindfold jerked away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yip-ee!” yelled Lefty, jumping aside. “Ride
’im, Connie!”</p>

<p class='c008'>For an instant Firewater stood perfectly still.
Then he ducked his head, shot up into the air and
came down stiff-legged. At every jump he
seemed to go a little higher and strike the ground
harder. Connie’s slender little body whipped
back and forth as she waved her hat and used her
rowels.</p>

<p class='c008'>But after a few minutes Firewater stopped
bucking and the girl rode him off across the sage.
She came back flushed and triumphant.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nice work,” praised Lefty as she slid to the
ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lefty, I’ve been thinking over what you said
about the rodeo,” Connie declared slowly. “Do
you really believe I’d have any chance to win that
prize for bronco riding?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I sure do, Connie. No girl around here would
have a chance against you, unless maybe it might
be Enid Bradshaw.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I could use five hundred dollars right now,”
Connie went on soberly. “I’ve decided to go out
for it, Lefty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The boys from the Rainbow will sure be pullin’
for you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll have to get busy and practice up,” Connie
declared. “Until rodeo time I expect to be one
big black and blue spot.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Rather well pleased with her decision to enter
the contest, the girl spent the afternoon making
an inspection of the ranch. Everywhere she
found evidence of careless management.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If only I could win five hundred dollars in the
rodeo, I’ll be able to pay Blakeman everything I
owe him,” she thought. “Then I can get rid of
him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>After her long ride over the range, Connie felt
more at peace with the world. Supper was over
when she saw a lone rider turn in at the gate.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, that’s Pop Bradshaw!” the girl thought
as she recognized the stout rancher. She quickly
arose from the porch and went to meet him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hello, there, Connie,” beamed the old man as
he stiffly dismounted. “Didn’t know you were
back home.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I arrived yesterday,” Connie answered
as she shook hands. “How is Enid?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, fine, fine. She’s grown a lot since you
saw her last, but for that matter, so have you.
Blakeman here, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, yes, he’s out at the barn,” Connie replied.
She wondered what had brought Pop
Bradshaw to the ranch but did not like to ask.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ride over an’ see Enid,” the old rancher invited
cordially. “She’ll be right glad to visit with
you again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll do that,” Connie promised.</p>

<p class='c008'>The old rancher went on toward the barn. Connie
sat down on the steps again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder what business Pop has with my foreman?”
she reflected. “If it’s anything to do with
the ranch, I’m the one he should see. But I don’t
seem to cut much ice around here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Since her arrival Connie had felt somewhat like
a guest. She had been treated with the greatest of
politeness by Forest Blakeman, but he paid scant
attention to any suggestion which she offered.
His attitude rather than his words had given her
to understand that he did not consider her opinions
worthy of notice.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie was thinking of going indoors when
Pop Bradshaw and the foreman emerged from
the barn. Pop was leading a horse. In the
gathering dusk the girl could not be certain which
animal it was. But as the two men came closer
she saw that it was Silvertail.</p>

<p class='c008'>The foreman did not notice Connie sitting on
the porch. He said to Pop Bradshaw:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, you’ve made a good bargain this time.
You’ve bought a fine hoss.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie wondered if she had heard correctly.
But she could not doubt her own ears, and besides,
she saw that the rancher was preparing to
lead Silvertail away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just a minute please,” she said, stepping forward.
“Mr. Blakeman, why is Pop Bradshaw
taking my horse?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, I bought him a few days ago,” answered
the rancher before the foreman could reply.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You bought Silvertail?” Connie echoed in
amazement. “But he’s <i>my</i> horse. I’d not sell him
to anyone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now be reasonable, Miss Connie,” interposed
Blakeman. “We need money and Silvertail’s not
much use as a cow pony. I thought the best thing
to do would be to get rid of him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You might have consulted me,” retorted Connie,
striving to control her anger.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t aim to take your hoss if you feel thet
way about it,” Pop Bradshaw said hastily. “It’s
nothin’ to me one way or the other.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you, Pop,” replied Connie gratefully.
“I couldn’t possibly let Silvertail go. Mr. Blakeman
quite overstepped his authority.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The foreman’s dark eyes flashed angrily, but
he made no comment until after the rancher had
ridden away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You made a mistake, Miss Connie,” he said
coldly. “You may not get another chance to sell
to a good owner like Pop.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll not sell Silvertail to anyone!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope you’re right,” returned the foreman
with a shrug. “But after you’ve talked with the
banker you may get a different idea!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br />Bad News</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Forest Blakeman’s words gave Connie
a strange feeling. For a moment it had
seemed to her that the foreman took satisfaction
in knowing that she was fighting with her back to
the wall. It was almost as if he wished to see her
lose Rainbow Ranch.</p>

<p class='c008'>She brushed aside the thought. After all, had
not Blakeman gone without his salary for many
months in an effort to stave off financial ruin? It
was unjust of her to question his motives. But
it would be hard for her to forgive him for trying
to sell Silvertail.</p>

<p class='c008'>Early the next morning Connie took the car
and drove in to Red Gulch. She was waiting at
the door of the First National Bank when it
opened at nine o’clock.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come right in, Miss Carl,” invited the president,
leading the way to his private office. Connie
thought he glanced at her a bit appraisingly as she
seated herself opposite him.</p>

<p class='c008'>She came straight to the point.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Haynes, I wanted to talk to you about our
note which is coming due in a few days.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes,” murmured the banker. “On the sixteenth,
I believe. I trust you are prepared to pay
it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, no, I’m not,” Connie admitted. “But
with a six months’ extension——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am afraid that is impossible, Miss Carl,” the
banker said quickly. “I should like to do it, of
course, but I must think of my depositors.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But Mr. Haynes, you don’t realize what this
will mean!” Connie cried. “I’ll lose my ranch—everything!
If only I had a little more time, even
three months——”</p>

<p class='c008'>The banker smiled tolerantly but shook his head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you had a year, Miss Carl, it would not
help. Ranching is no longer the profitable industry
it was in your father’s time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I could make it pay if only I had a little time,”
Connie insisted desperately. “I’d take summer
boarders—dudes from the city.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I fear you haven’t the capital for that,” smiled
the banker. “I know exactly how you feel, Miss
Carl, and I only wish I might help you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie left the bank feeling discouraged and
almost ill. Mr. Haynes’ attitude had stunned
her. She had never believed that he would refuse
to extend the note.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Somehow I must raise fifteen hundred dollars
before the sixteenth of the month,” she told herself
grimly. “But how? There’s no possible
way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie crossed over to the grocery store where
she bought a box of supplies to take back to Rainbow
Ranch. She chatted for a few minutes with
the genial owner, Joe Ferris, who had known her
since she was a child. It was well after the noon
hour when finally she started home.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girl drove automatically, her mind absorbed
with the problem which beset her. Upon
reaching the ranch she avoided Blakeman, feeling
that she could not bear to talk with him in her
present mood.</p>

<p class='c008'>Slipping out to the barn she saddled Silvertail
and went for a run through the sage. The rush of
cool air seemed to quiet her nerves. She rode toward
the vermilion cliffs, following an indistinct
trail but one which Connie knew well.</p>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly Silvertail shied. The girl was
startled to see a man lying on the ground ahead of
her. Instantly she thought that it was someone
in hiding, then she saw that he lay perfectly still.</p>

<p class='c008'>Springing from the saddle, Connie ran to him
and dropped on her knees. He was a lean young
man, clean-shaven and pale. She had never seen
him before.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you hurt?” she gasped.</p>

<p class='c008'>The man stirred, opened his eyes and tried to
smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Water,” he mumbled.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie ran to get it from her canteen. She
pressed the container to the man’s lips and he
drank thirstily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not too much,” she warned.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tearing off the sleeve of her blouse she sopped it
in water and sponged his forehead.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How did you get here?” she asked. “Where
is your horse?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Haven’t any,” the man mumbled. “I walked
from Red Gulch.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You walked!” exclaimed Connie. “No wonder
you had a touch of heat. You’re a stranger
around these parts, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess maybe I am,” the man admitted. “I’m
looking for a job. They told me in Red Gulch I
might get one out at Rainbow Ranch. I started
walking but I couldn’t find the place.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, you’re at Rainbow Ranch now,” declared
Connie. “But as for getting a riding or
cowboy job——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can ride even if I don’t own a horse,” the man
said quickly. “My name is Jim Barrows.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m real glad to meet you,” replied Connie
smiling.</p>

<p class='c008'>She liked the young man but she doubted very
much that he could ride or that he knew anything
about ranch work. A cowboy never would have
tried to walk the distance from Red Gulch, nor
would one accustomed to outdoor life have been
affected by the sun. Jim Barrows obviously was
a tenderfoot.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here, let me help you,” she said kindly as the
man tried to raise himself. “If you’re able to ride
my horse I can get you to the ranch house. Or
maybe it would be better to go for help.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I can make it,” Jim Barrows insisted.
“My head isn’t so woozy now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie helped him into the saddle, observing
that he really did know how to mount. Then she
led Silvertail down the trail.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What made you think of getting a job at
Rainbow Ranch?” she asked presently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They told me in Red Gulch that the place was
badly in need of a few good men. I guess the
ranch has been run by a girl who lives in the East
and she’s let it go to pieces.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie bit her lip and avoided looking at Jim
Barrows.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I need a job mighty bad,” the man went on.
“Fact is, I’ve not had a square meal in a week.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll see that you get one as soon as we reach the
house,” Connie promised.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sorry to put you to so much trouble, Miss.
Say, do you live near here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, at Rainbow Ranch,” the girl answered,
laughing. “I neglected to tell you my name. I
am Connie Carl.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, you’re the girl who owns the ranch!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, I didn’t mean anything——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t worry about that,” said Connie quickly.
“I know what people are saying, and in a way it
is true. I trusted too much in the ability of my
foreman. About that job, I’ll have Blakeman
talk with you. We are short handed, but I’m
afraid we can’t pay very much even for a good
cowhand.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d be willing to work almost for my grub.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In that case I think we should be able to come
to some sort of deal,” Connie laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lefty and Alkali were working in the corrals
when the girl led the horse into the courtyard.
They turned to stare at the stranger.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lefty!” Connie called. “Come here and help
Mr. Barrows into the house. Tell Marie to give
him all the food he can eat.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You bet!” replied the cowboy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Supported by Lefty, the stranger walked quite
steadily into the kitchen. Connie went to find
the foreman. He was not at the barn or in the
leather shop, but when she returned a few minutes
later to the house, she discovered him talking
angrily with Lefty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who is this stranger?” he demanded. “What’s
he doing here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll have to ask Connie,” returned Lefty
with a shrug. “I don’t know nothin’ about it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was just looking for you, Mr. Blakeman,”
said Connie. “I found the man lying on the trail.
He’s down on his luck and hasn’t had a square
meal in days. I brought him here. I thought you
might find some work for him to do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We can’t pay the men we have now,” the foreman
snapped. “Anyway, I don’t like the looks of
this fellow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do,” said Connie quietly. “My father never
would have turned a man away when he was
hungry and half-sick.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s no more sick than you are,” retorted the
foreman. “I can tell when a guy is puttin’ on.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t agree with you at all,” returned Connie.
“What reason would he have for pretending
that he was ill?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t like him,” said Blakeman stubbornly.
“We ought to cut down expenses wherever we
can.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A few dollars won’t make any difference now.
I wish you would hire him, Mr. Blakeman.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We could use a herder,” spoke up Lefty.
“The cattle in that southeast section have been
gittin’ out into the road. Another calf was killed
yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The foreman glared angrily at the cowboy and
started to walk away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just a minute,” Connie called after him. “I’ll
tell Barrows that he is hired.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s your ranch,” the foreman said sullenly.
“But you’re making a mistake!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie made no reply but went into the kitchen.
Jim Barrows had just finished the ample lunch
which Marie had set before him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I couldn’t help overhearing,” he said to Connie.
“Thanks for going down the line to help me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll be glad to have you work here,” smiled
Connie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope you didn’t get into trouble on my account.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie shook her head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Blakeman is only my foreman. I’m really the
boss here, but he doesn’t seem to realize it. I
guess maybe that’s because he knows I’ll probably
lose the ranch in a short while.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie did not go on for she felt that she had
told the stranger too much already. He regarded
her curiously but did not ask leading questions.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When do I start work?” he inquired presently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, whenever you feel able,” Connie told
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m a lot better already,” the man declared
heartily. “I’ll be ready to go to work in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>After Connie had gone, Jim Barrows wandered
outdoors. He went out to the corrals and talked
for a time with Lefty and Alkali. The foreman
coldly ignored him, but the other cowboys tried to
be friendly. It came to them by degrees that the
stranger knew more about ranch work than they
had thought.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s something queer about that fellow,”
Lefty confided to Connie later on.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How do you mean?” she asked quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Seems to me like I’ve seen him before, only I
can’t remember where,” the cowboy said, scratching
his shaggy locks. “But I’m dead sure of one
thing. Jim Barrows ain’t the greenhorn we took
him to be.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIV' class='c009'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br />The Foreman’s Boast</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Try as she would, Connie could not rest that
night. Her mind was a turmoil of worries
which made anything but fitful sleep impossible.
The girl stood long by her bedroom window, gazing
out across the moonlit ranch which had been
her childhood home; now her sole possession. She
could not rid her mind of the fear that soon her
beloved Rainbow would pass into the hands of
another owner. At dawn she dressed and sauntered
down to the stables.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Connie was a little girl she liked nothing
better than to get up early to see the sunrise; and
this morning, as the eastern sky reddened against
the distant mountains, the old scenes lived again.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie was startled from her reverie by the
sound of masculine voices coming from the bunkhouse.
The cowboys were starting the day with
their usual round of banter. They talked so
loudly that she could not help hearing every word
that the men said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, Alkali,” Lefty Forbes drawled, “in a
few days now me and you can feast our eyes on
the champeen bulldogger of these here parts.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Meanin’ who?” Alkali asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, meanin’ old Blakeman hisself. To hear
him tell it a man would think nobody even heard
of bulldoggin’ till he came along.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wouldn’t lay no money on him,” Alkali said.
“The guy is a big loud-speaker.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And that ain’t all he is nuther,” Lefty added.
“He’s a washout when it comes to runnin’ a ranch.
Look at the jam he’s got this place into.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yeah, and Miss Connie walked right into it.
What a homecomin’!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know. Alkali. And I feel rotten about the
whole deal. Miss Connie is one swell kid. If it
weren’t for her I’d quit today.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At that moment the girl saw Forest Blakeman
approaching from around the house. She wished
to warn Lefty and Alkali. If the foreman heard
them there might be trouble.</p>

<p class='c008'>Picking up a large clod of earth she tossed it
against the bunk-house door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hey, what’s that?” Lefty shouted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Both cowboys emerged and looked about.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was only I,” Connie laughed. Then she
jerked her head in the direction from which Blakeman
approached.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There comes your friend now,” she said, her
voice lowered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, that big ape,” Alkali muttered, scorn in
his voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>The foreman came up to the trio, looking
quickly from one to the other. He remarked that
Connie was abroad early.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, Mr. Blakeman,” she replied. “I couldn’t
sleep so I wandered down here. Beautiful sunrise,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s o.k., I reckon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think we are going to have fine weather for
the rodeo,” Connie continued mischievously.
“Are you in any of the events, Mr. Blakeman?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell her, Blake!” laughed Lefty and there was
an edge to his voice. “Tell her they couldn’t run
the show without you doin’ some fancy bulldoggin’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yeah!” Alkali put in. “They don’t come no
hotter than Blake when he sets himself to dump
over a steer by his horns.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now listen, you two,” Blakeman said, perceptibly
angered. “I don’t have to take any sarcasm
from a couple of cow stooges like you! I’ll
show you what I can do. I’ll be on hand for the
bulldoggin’ and I hope you lugs lay your money
against me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Having delivered himself of this defy, Forest
Blakeman turned on his heel and walked off.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll be there to see it, won’t we, Alkali?”
Lefty chortled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“With both of our hair in one braid,” Alkali
agreed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just wait till Blake goes up against Catapult.
Boy, oh boy, will that steer ruin him?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie did not quite follow the two men’s conversation.
She wondered who this Catapult
might be.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, that’s Pop Bradshaw’s prize bulldoggin’
steer, Miss Connie,” Lefty explained. “That
old hunk of animated baloney has got a neck that’s
made of pure spring steel.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It sure is,” Alkali confirmed. “That steer
ain’t never been throwed in his whole life. If you
ask me there ain’t a man a-livin’ who can do it,
nuther.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He must be quite an animal,” Connie remarked,
laughing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Blakeman’s been braggin’ all winter he’s a
champeen bulldogger,” Alkali went on contemptuously.
“No one round here ain’t even seen
him toss up a cow!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The talk ceased abruptly as Jim Barrows came
up from the house. He walked with a firm step
and seemed to have fully recovered his strength.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re to start herdin’ in the southeast section,”
Lefty told him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll ride out that way with you after breakfast,”
Connie said quickly. “I thought I might
go over to the Bradshaw ranch.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The stranger nodded and followed Lefty to the
corrals. He roped his own horse and did it neatly
the girl observed. By the time she had finished
breakfast he was ready to start and had saddled
Silvertail for her.</p>

<p class='c008'>As they rode along, Connie kept stealing quick
glances at her companion. She could not figure
him out. Lefty had been right in saying that he
was no tenderfoot. But who was he?</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie might have asked a number of direct
questions, but she did not. After all, Jim Barrows’
business was his own, she thought. She had
no call to inquire into his private life.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the Forks the girl said good-bye and rode
on toward the Bradshaw ranch where she hoped to
renew her friendship with Enid.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s three long years since we’ve seen each
other,” she thought. “I imagine we’ve both
changed a great deal.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie unhooked the gate without dismounting
and galloped up the lane to the ranch house. The
sound of hoofbeats brought both Enid and her
father to the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Connie!” cried Enid, rushing out to meet her.
“My, but it’s good to see you again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie sprang lightly to the ground, tossing the
reins over Silvertail’s head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re surely a wonderful sight for sore eyes
yourself!” she declared. “I thought you’d be coming
over to see me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Enid glanced quickly at her father and then
looked away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well—I intended to come—but——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know,” said Connie quickly, “I haven’t been
home many days.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on into the house,” Enid invited.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hear you happen to own a champion steer by
the name of Catapult, Mr. Bradshaw,” remarked
Connie as she stepped up on the veranda.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Reckon I do,” answered the rancher.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d love to see Catapult,” Connie went on.
“All the boys are saying no one can throw him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Catapult’s out on the range now,” replied the
rancher. It seemed to Connie that his voice was
not very friendly. At any rate he did not carry
on the conversation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on into the house, Connie,” urged Enid
hurriedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie spent a pleasant hour with her friend,
but there were moments when they both felt ill
at ease and at a loss for something to say.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s only because we haven’t seen each other
for such a long while,” Connie thought. When
she left she gave Enid a cordial invitation to ride
over to the Rainbow.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the days which followed the girl found much
to occupy her time at the ranch. She spent many
hours in the saddle practicing for the rodeo. Sometimes
she rode alone and occasionally with the new
cowhand, Jim Barrows. He had proven himself to
be both quiet and efficient, but his very ability
seemed to infuriate Forest Blakeman who gave
him the most disagreeable tasks about the ranch.</p>

<p class='c008'>Twice Connie drove over to the Bradshaw
Ranch. She and Enid had delightful visits and
at times they came close to recapturing the old
feeling of comradeship which had existed between
them. But always Connie sensed that Pop Bradshaw
did not seem to like her. At least he never
became cordial or even as friendly as upon the day
of their first meeting.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t mind Pop,” Enid said to her once.
“He’s not himself these days. We’ve been losing
money on the ranch, and you know what this place
means to him. He’d rather give an eye than lose
it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know exactly how he feels,” Connie replied.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although she went many times to the Bradshaw
Ranch, Enid never once came to the Rainbow. At
first Connie was puzzled and then hurt.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I feel almost as if Enid didn’t like me at times,”
she thought. “Can it be that she’s jealous because
I’ll compete against her in the riding contest?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie could not really believe that Enid would
take such a narrow-minded attitude. Yet something
was wrong. She was certain of that.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll not go to the Bradshaw Ranch until she
comes over to see me,” Connie thought.</p>

<p class='c008'>Several days elapsed and Enid did not visit
Rainbow Ranch. A sense of hurt gave way to one
of indignation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, if that’s how she feels about it, I’ll show
her I really can ride!” Connie told herself grimly.
“I’ll win that prize if it’s the last thing I ever do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>That very afternoon she roped Dynamite, one
of the most unmanageable horses on the ranch.
Despite the efforts of every cowboy at the Rainbow,
Dynamite had never been successfully
broken.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Connie, you’re plumb crazy to try it,” Lefty
told her. “That hoss is a sunfisher. He’ll go over
on his back sure as shootin’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie would not be dissuaded. With Lefty’s
help she saddled the broncho, while the other cowboys
came to the corral fence to watch.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the blindfold was jerked from Dynamite’s
eyes and the gate swung open. The bronco shot
up into the air, twisted and came down with a
terrific jar which all but unseated Connie. Again
he leaped, seeming to double in the middle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ride ’im, Connie!” shouted Lefty.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Dynamite had not played his best trick.
He shot straight into the air and before the girl
could free herself, came down on his back. Connie
was pinned beneath.</p>

<p class='c008'>A yell went up from the cowboys, but it was
Jim Barrows who was the first to act. His rope
sailed out to catch the fallen bronco, thus preventing
Dynamite from running while Connie’s
feet were still in the stirrups.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you bad hurt?” Lefty cried as he and
Alkali ran to help her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I’m all right,” Connie said shakily.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her face was pale and twisted with pain.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You <i>are</i> hurt, kid,” Lefty said, lifting her to
her feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just my shoulder,” Connie muttered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No bones busted?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not even a little one, Lefty. But I did twist
my shoulder pretty hard.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie tried to laugh and failed completely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It served me right,” she said. “I should have
known enough to stay off Dynamite. I was trying
to show off.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie brushed the dirt from her clothes and
walked slowly to the house, conscious that the
cowboys were watching her soberly. She had done
a very foolish thing in trying to ride Dynamite.
The penalty was apt to be great.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Unless my shoulder mends rapidly I’ll never
be able to ride in the rodeo,” she thought. “And
without that five hundred dollars I haven’t a
Chinaman’s chance of saving the ranch.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chV' class='c009'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br />Pop Bradshaw’s Treachery</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the morning Connie’s shoulder was so stiff
and sore that the slightest movement of her
arm gave her great pain. At Lefty’s suggestion
she rode in to Red Gulch to consult old Doctor
Horn. Other than to give her a liniment to rub
on, there was nothing he could do.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just rest the muscles for the next two weeks,”
he advised. “It will gradually get better.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I’m planning to ride in the rodeo,” Connie
declared anxiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>The doctor shook his head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t do anything foolish, Connie. I doubt
very much that your shoulder will be well by that
time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie left the doctor’s office feeling as if all
her troubles had reached a climax. She knew she
had no one to blame save herself, yet that made it
no easier.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was walking along, eyes on the ground
when she heard her name called. Turning quickly
she saw Nate Jordan, an old rancher who had
been a close friend of her father’s. He operated
a profitable dude ranch, the Circle R, near
Santa Fe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, hello, Nate!” cried Connie in delight.
“What are you doing up in our country?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You should ask,” laughed the rancher.
“Didn’t I just sell your foreman one of my best
steers?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How should I know?” retorted Connie in a
light vein. “After all I’m only the owner of the
ranch. You didn’t really sell Blakeman a steer?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shore did, Connie. Thought you knew all
about it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I certainly didn’t,” the girl replied soberly.
“Nate, Blakeman shouldn’t have done that without
asking me. I’m so hard up for money I don’t
know when we’ll be able to pay—if ever.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Blakeman settled for cash,” the rancher told
her. “But if you don’t want to go through with
the deal it’s all right with me. Just have one of
your men trundle the steer back to the Circle R.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you just now take the animal to the ranch,
Nate?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, Blakeman came for the steer himself
yesterday afternoon. I rode over this way today
to see a man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s funny,” said Connie slowly. “Blakeman
didn’t say anything to me about buying a
steer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, suit yourself about keepin’ the animal.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thanks, Nate,” said Connie gratefully. “I’ll
talk it over with Blakeman when I get back to the
ranch.”</p>

<p class='c008'>All the way to the Rainbow she puzzled over
Blakeman’s strange deal with the rancher. She
was almost positive that the foreman had not
brought a steer to the ranch the previous day. In
fact, she remembered seeing him when he rode
into the yard and had noticed how tired his pony
appeared.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If Blakeman doesn’t have enough money to
pay salaries, how could he buy a steer?” she reflected.
“Especially when we don’t need one.
There’s something mighty queer about this business.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The foreman was nowhere about when Connie
reached the ranch. However, she asked both
Lefty and Alkali if any new stock had been bought
and both assured her in the negative.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I believe I’ll just wait and see if Blakeman
says anything about the matter to me,” she
thought.</p>

<p class='c008'>Later when the foreman returned she carelessly
mentioned that she had seen Nate in town. While
Blakeman gave her a quick, sharp glance, he said
nothing about the steer. Connie was further puzzled
because her inspection of the ranch stock did
not reveal an addition to the herds.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did he buy that steer with his own money or
with mine?” Connie speculated. “And where is
the animal?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She spent the morning going over the records
which Blakeman had kept. The foreman had not
been a good bookkeeper and it was almost impossible
to tell anything about his figures.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He may have cheated me,” the girl thought.
“I can’t tell. But in any event, it looks as if the
ranch will not pay for itself on the present basis.
My only hope would be to operate a dude ranch,
but I can’t do that without money.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie glanced at the calendar and frowned.
Only two more days until the rodeo, and then a
scant ten days before the sixteenth. She was
certain she could never meet her obligations.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d have a chance if I could win a few prizes
at the rodeo,” she told herself. “Oh, why did I
have to cripple myself?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie tried to move her right arm and winced
with pain. She thought the muscles weren’t quite
as sore as they had been. Perhaps she would
enter the riding contest anyway.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girl was sitting moodily by the window
when she heard hoofbeats in the courtyard. Enid
came riding up to the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie’s depression vanished as if by magic
and she rushed out to greet the ranch girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Connie, I just heard about how you hurt
yourself!” Enid cried as she alighted and looped
her lines over the hitching post. “Will you be
out of the rodeo?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not sure,” Connie answered. She felt
warmed because Enid had cared enough to ride
over to the ranch. At the same time she was
ashamed because she had doubted the girl’s friendliness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I hope you are able to ride,” Enid went
on. “It will be too mean if you’re forced out of
the contest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do come in and stay for lunch,” Connie invited
cordially.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no I can’t,” Enid said hastily. “I really
shouldn’t have come, only Dad went to town to
see a man——”</p>

<p class='c008'>She broke off in confusion as if she had revealed
too much.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Doesn’t your father like you to come here?”
Connie asked quietly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, he—oh, it isn’t that,” Enid began to
stammer. “I can’t explain, Connie, but Pop has
changed lately. He isn’t himself—he——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think I understand,” Connie said quietly,
although she didn’t at all.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope I’ll see you at the rodeo,” Enid declared
hastily. “I’ll have to be riding back now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Without looking directly at her friend, she
sprang into the saddle and rode from the yard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pop Bradshaw has told her to keep away from
me,” Connie thought shrewdly. “One would
think I might be a brand of poison! There’s something
going on around here that I don’t understand.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Scarcely had Enid left the courtyard when
Forest Blakeman strode up to where Connie was
standing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wasn’t that Enid Bradshaw?” he asked
curtly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did she want to see me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If she did, she forgot to mention it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The foreman made no reply, but turned and
walked swiftly toward the barn. A few minutes
later Connie saw him ride away down the road.
It occurred to her as she watched the disappearing
figure that in the past few days Blakeman had
made many unexplained trips.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d like to find out where he’s going,” she decided
impulsively. “It may be a sneaking trick
to follow, but that’s exactly what I shall do!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie saddled Silvertail and without telling
anyone of her purpose, rode in pursuit of Blakeman,
taking care to keep a long distance behind
him. In a very short time she was convinced that
he was on his way to Red Gulch.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s probably going there to buy nails or
something of the sort,” the girl thought. “But
since I’ve come this far I may as well keep on.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie lagged even farther behind, for she did
not wish the foreman to suspect that he was being
trailed.</p>

<p class='c008'>When she finally came into Red Gulch Blakeman
was nowhere in sight, but she saw his mare
tied up in front of the pool hall. Connie had no
errands to occupy her time so she thought she
would drop over to the doctor’s office.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You should never ride in the rodeo,” he said
to her after he had examined her shoulder. “But
I know it’s no use to tell you that. So go ahead.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you, doctor,” laughed Connie.</p>

<p class='c008'>She left his office feeling in a much better mood.
Suddenly she slackened her speed as she saw
Forest Blakeman just ahead of her. He was
entering the Norton Cafe. Connie was quite certain
he had not seen her.</p>

<p class='c008'>She walked slowly on, wondering whether or
not to return to Rainbow Ranch. Although she
had tied Silvertail on a side street, the foreman
might see the horse. Then of course he would
know that she had followed him unless she had
a ready excuse for her trip to town.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie was so absorbed with her thoughts that
she bumped squarely into a heavy-set man who
was coming from the opposite direction. It was
Pop Bradshaw.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, hello, Pop!” said Connie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“’Mornin’,” responded the old rancher uneasily.</p>

<p class='c008'>He turned and entered the Norton Cafe. Connie
glanced curiously through the plate glass window.
Forest Blakeman was nowhere in sight so
she knew that he must have stepped into one of
the ice cream booths. And now Pop Bradshaw
disappeared from sight in a similar manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It looks to me as if they are meeting each other
by appointment,” Connie mused. “What business
can they be having together?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her suspicions aroused, Connie quietly entered
the cafe, seating herself in a booth adjoining the
one occupied by the two men. She knew they
were there for she could hear their voices.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d not advise you to double cross me, Pop!”
Blakeman said distinctly although in a low tone.
“This is a fine time to get cold feet!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t get excited now,” returned Pop in a
quavery voice. “I’ll do as I said. I’m only sayin’
it goes agin’ my grain to play it on the boys thet
way with them all thinkin’ I’ve entered Catapult
in the rodeo same as always.”</p>

<p class='c008'>By this time Connie was all attention. She
leaned closer to the wall so that she would not miss
a single word.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s get this straight,” said the cool voice of
the foreman. “I paid you five hundred dollars
to keep that old horned rhinoceros of yours out of
the show. You agreed and took the money and
now you’re cryin’ around about me playin’ it dirty
on the boys. You knew it was dirty before you
took the money, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I didn’t realize it then, I reckon. I’m ready
and willin’ to pay you back.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And leave me holdin’ the sack! Oh, no you
don’t! Where have you got that steer now?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, he’s safe enough,” replied the rancher.
“He’s in the mountain meadow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then see that he stays there until after the
rodeo,” said the foreman. “Deliver Nate’s steer
to the rodeo barns tomorrow just as I told you.
That’s all you have to do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie waited to hear no more. Quietly she
slipped away from the cafe.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVI' class='c009'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br />Kidnaping Catapult</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Connie felt a trifle stunned by the conversation
which she had overheard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d never have believed it if I hadn’t heard with
my own ears,” she thought. “Pop Bradshaw, who
has stood for everything honest and square in this
community! For five hundred dollars he means
to keep Catapult out of the rodeo, substituting a
steer which Blakeman will be sure to throw in the
bulldogging event!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The girl mounted Silvertail and started slowly
Back toward the ranch. She rode along in deep
thought for a time.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll not let Blakeman get by with it!” she exclaimed.
“It’s a cheap, contemptible trick!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie was smiling by the time she reached the
ranch. She knew exactly what to do. Calling
Lefty and Alkali she asked them casually if bets
were running heavy on the bulldogging event.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure, Blakeman’s goin’ to lose his shirt,” Lefty
grinned. “He’s been coverin’ everything in
sight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He hasn’t a chance against Catapult,” added
Alkali with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s just the point I was about to bring up,”
said Connie quietly. “Supposing another steer
should be substituted for Catapult?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s no chance of that,” declared Lefty.
“Pop Bradshaw entered old Catapult two weeks
ago.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I’ve just learned something which will
interest you. Pop plans to substitute another
steer for Catapult—one which resembles him in
appearance, I judge.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie then repeated every word of the conversation
she had heard in the restaurant.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, the dirty crook!” exclaimed Lefty. “No
wonder Blakeman was so willin’ to cover all bets.
He thought he’d clean up pretty!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We got to do something about this!” muttered
Alkali. “Let’s protest to the committee.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“An’ spoil all the fun?” said Lefty. “No, I
got a better idea! We’ll kidnap old Catapult tonight
and sneak him into the rodeo barns! Then
Pop can’t squawk without givin’ himself and the
whole scheme away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That idea ain’t nothin’ to whoop ’em up
about,” complained Alkali. “That mountain
medder is in plain sight of Pop’s house. It’s surrounded
by hills and there’s just one way out.
That’s down the trail past Pop’s buildings.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We can do it real quiet-like so he won’t ketch
us,” insisted Lefty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you reckon Catapult’s tracks on the
trail will show?” Alkali asked jeeringly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Trust Papa,” replied Lefty with a mysterious
grin.</p>

<p class='c008'>The two cowboys separated, after pledging
Connie to secrecy regarding their proposed adventure.
Lefty immediately rode to Red Gulch
to hold a confidential consultation with Jack
Crawford who was in charge of the barns at the
rodeo.</p>

<p class='c008'>In an hour Forest Blakeman returned to the
ranch without explaining where he had been. But
all that day he was aware of curious stares which
followed him. He could feel that something was
in the air. Now and then coming unexpectedly
upon a group of cowboys he would hear his name
being mentioned. In anger he vented his spite
upon Jim Barrows.</p>

<p class='c008'>The day passed slowly. Connie went to her
room early but she did not go to bed. Instead
she read until nearly midnight. Then she snapped
out her light and sat by the window.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a short time she saw Lefty and Alkali emerge
from the bunkhouse carrying several gunnysacks.
At their shrill whistle, she quickly joined them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alkali led Silvertail and two broncos down to
the main road where they all mounted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are you planning to do with the gunnysacks?”
Connie asked curiously as they rode
toward the Bradshaw Ranch.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m aimin’ to tie ’em on Catapult’s hooves so
he won’t leave no tracks,” explained Lefty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ain’t that the dizziest idear any sane guy ever
had?” demanded Alkali. “How we goin’ to get
gunnysacks on Catapult? Maybe you think he’ll
just hold up his feet nice an’ purty like he was in
a shoe shop!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now see here,” Lefty said sharply. “Are you
with me or ain’t you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I’m with you all right,” drawled Alkali,
“but my doubts sure are percolatin’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>All was still about the Bradshaw Ranch as the
three rode quietly into the mountain meadow. No
lights were burning in the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie and the two cowboys tied their horses
to a clump of cottonwood trees. Lefty removed
the gunnysacks from his saddle and Alkali threw
a coil of rope over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It may not be easy to find Catapult,” Connie
whispered. “This is a big meadow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yeah,” Alkali added, “he’s apt to be roostin’
in any one of these thousand acres.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I figure Catapult will be parked by the lake
for the night after this blisterin’ hot day,” said
Lefty. “That old uncanned baloney has more
sense than his owner.”</p>

<p class='c008'>After a brisk walk the three approached the
lake. From that point they moved cautiously,
crawling forward until they reached the bank.
Lefty pulled aside a clump of overhanging tree
branches and looked out over the moonlit water.
A dark blot appeared at the opposite end of the
lake and Lefty’s excited fancy envisioned it as a
life-sized steer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s Catapult, Alkali, sure as you’re a cow
nurse!” he muttered. “He’s standin’ in up to
his belly, a-swishin’ flies with his tail.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The three conspirators crept slowly around the
little lake to the rear of the place where Catapult’s
presence was suspected.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s him!” exclaimed Lefty. “Get your rope
ready, Alkali, and if you nail him, tie the other end
to this here tree. Then I’ll wade out and shoo him
in.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The rope swished through the air and landed
fairly around the big steer’s head. Lefty waded
out toward the frightened animal, circling around
him and splashing water with his cupped hands.
Connie watched anxiously because she was afraid
that Catapult might turn upon the cowboy and
gore him with his sharp horns. But instead. Catapult
bolted headlong for shore.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Keep him circlin’ ’round the tree,” Lefty
called to Alkali as he followed the steer ashore.</p>

<p class='c008'>The two cowboys drove Catapult around and
around the tree until his head banged into it. Then
they roped his front and hind legs together. Catapult
fell to the ground and rolled over on his side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now come on with them gunnysacks,” Lefty
said exaultantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alkali chuckled as he helped his friend bind the
pads on the steer’s feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Guess we better bring up our hosses before
we untie this here bovine,” he chuckled. “He’d
make us feel like a tail to a kite a hoofin’ it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Alkali disappeared into the darkness and soon
returned, riding his own horse and leading the
other two.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pass me that rope, Lefty,” he directed. “Then
you can untie him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The frightened steer arose to his feet with a
snort. He eyed his tormentors for a moment and
then bolted. Alkali’s horse braced and Catapult
was brought up sharply.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’ll soon wear out them gunnysacks at this
rate,” Lefty lamented. “We’ve got to quiet him
down.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Get a rope on him too if you can,” Alkali advised.
“Move up ahead. I’ll stay behind. Then
when he makes a pass at you, I’ll hold him, and
when he lays back you yank him right along with
you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lefty’s rope swished through the air and settled
neatly over Catapult’s thick neck. Then
riding ahead, with Alkali’s rope leading to the
rear, the two cowboys began their task of leading
Catapult from the meadow.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie found it hard to control her laughter.
The steer presented such a ludicrous spectacle
even in the uncertain moonlight, thumbing along
the trail shod in gunnysacks. At times he would
stop as if trying to fathom the strange method of
torment. Then Lefty’s rope would become taut
and pull him along. Again he would take a lunge
forward in a brave effort to escape but Alkali’s
rope would stiffen and bring him up short.</p>

<p class='c008'>They emerged from the mountain meadow and
turned to the main road. Connie breathed a sigh
of relief.</p>

<p class='c008'>And just at that moment Catapult stopped and
whiffed the night air. Then he gave voice to the
loudest and longest bellow in his system.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If Pop hears that we’re sunk,” groaned Lefty.</p>

<p class='c008'>A light flickered in the ranch house.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He heard it all right,” muttered Alkali.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now what are we going to do?” asked Connie
nervously. “You always have such brilliant ideas.
Lefty! Think of something quick!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVII' class='c009'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br />A Midnight Escapade</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A thicket of small trees and bushes
loomed up in the moonlight fifty yards
ahead of the trio. Lefty pointed to the spot as he
said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll have to park in there and take a chance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Scarcely had the unique cavalcade disappeared
into the thicket when Pop Bradshaw and his foreman
emerged from the ranch house. They looked
about and then walked over to the meadow trail.
Connie and the cowboys could hear them conversing
in low tones and they saw Pop shoot the beam
of his flashlight on the trail.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We must have dreamed it, Sam,” he said in a
puzzled tone. “The only way out of the meadow
is down this trail and there’s not a fresh steer
track on it. Just a few horse and shoe tracks
where some of the boys went in to do a little fishin’
at the lake.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The two men walked back to the ranch house.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was a narrow escape,” chuckled Connie
as Lefty and Alkali started Catapult on the move
again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure was,” Lefty agreed. “I’ll be glad when
we get this critter to the rodeo barns.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie parted company with the cowboys
farther on down the road, returning alone to the
ranch while they delivered Catapult into the keeping
of Jack Crawford. It was after two o’clock
when she reached home. Letting herself quietly
into the house, she went to bed and slept so soundly
that she did not awaken until Marie opened the
door in the morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I had no idea it was so late!” Connie cried
in dismay. “If I don’t hurry I’ll be late for the
rodeo.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As she hurriedly dressed in cowgirl regalia
which she planned to wear in the parade, she tried
out her shoulder. It was still sore, but she could
bear the pain now when she moved it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie had coffee and rolls in the <i>patio</i> alone,
and then hastened outside. Lefty and Alkali,
resplendent in bright colored shirts and silver-trimmed
sombreros, were saddling up their broncos
ready to start for Red Gulch. Blakeman and
Jim Barrows already had left.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How did you come out last night after we
parted company?” she asked quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Everything’s set,” chuckled Lefty. “And you
should have heard old Blake a-blowin’ around this
morning. He thinks he has that bulldoggin’ event
cinched. Wait ’till Catapult gives him the double
’o’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie laughed and declared that she would
not miss the fun for anything in the world. Saddling
Silvertail she rode into Red Gulch with her
friends. On the way in she told them of her determination
to compete in the various events open
to girls.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re takin’ a big chance with that game
shoulder,” Lefty declared. “I wouldn’t do it if
I was you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That money means a lot to me,” Connie replied
soberly. “If I could win the five hundred dollar
prize, I might be able to raise enough extra so I
could meet my bank obligations. Then I’d be able
to keep the ranch.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll sure be a-pullin’ for you, Connie,”
Alkali declared warmly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Red Gulch was jammed with visitors even at
such an early hour. The town was decorated with
flags; bands, playing slightly off key, marched up
and down the streets. Cowboys in big hats and
high-heeled boots lounged in the doorways of
buildings calling out friendly greetings to
passers-by. Indians from nearby reservations
added to the crowd.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the entrance of the Fairgrounds Connie
parted with her friends. While she went to the
rodeo barn to look over the horses. Lefty and
Alkali wandered toward the arena. Immediately
an official hailed them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can use you boys,” he said. “I want you to
keep everyone except rodeo officers, performers
and owners out of the ring.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lefty and Alkali leaped the fence and strolled
about observing the fast-gathering throngs that
swarmed into the terraced tiers of the wooden
grandstand. Men in charge of the day’s activities
hustled about on horseback, calling orders, while
a group of starters and judges conferred at the
distant end of the arena.</p>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly Lefty’s eyes were arrested by the
sight of Pop Bradshaw talking with Forest Blakeman
near the arena fence. An intriguing idea
flashed into his mind. What could be sweeter
than for Pop to be among those immediately present
when Catapult magically appeared in place of
the steer which he believed had been substituted?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on in. Pop,” he called. “We want you
in here to see that Catapult gets a square deal.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The idea delighted the crowd. The old man
hesitated but friendly hands seized and boosted
him over the fence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie, who understood the prank which the
cowboys were playing on Pop, felt rather sorry
for him. But she had no sympathy for Forest
Blakeman. He was swaggering about the arena,
his attitude proclaiming that already he had been
named the champion bulldogger.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Connie stood by the fence, Jim Barrows
sauntered over. After making a few casual remarks
he fell silent, but the girl noticed that his
gaze followed Blakeman almost constantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your foreman reminds me of someone,” he
said thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s funny,” laughed Connie. “Blakeman
was saying almost the same thing to me about
you. By the way, where did you work before you
came to the Rainbow, Jim?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, one place and another,” the man answered
vaguely. “Mostly on ranches down in Texas.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Without giving Connie an opportunity to ask
another question, he moved away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He certainly means to keep his past his own,”
the girl reflected thoughtfully. “I never met anyone
so reserved. I wonder if perhaps he hasn’t
been in trouble sometime?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie dismissed the matter from her mind
because it was time for the opening parade. She
rode in it, side by side with Enid Bradshaw. The
other girl nodded almost curtly to Connie, offering
no remark save to ask about her injured
shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie tried not to show her hurt at Enid’s
attitude. It only made her more determined than
ever to win in the riding event.</p>

<p class='c008'>The preliminary contests were quickly run off.
Roping events, steer riding and Indian races excited
but passing interest.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last the bulldogging event was called. Several
cowboys from the Bar Six Ranch performed
with a skill which brought cheers from the crowd.
The steer was allowed a thirty foot start after he
had rushed from the pen. Then horse and rider
were after him, with a hazer to keep the animal in a
straight course. Catching the steer by the horns,
the cowboy would hurl himself from the saddle,
and twist the animal’s horns until he rolled over
in the dust.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bring on Blakeman!” shouted the crowd.
“Let’s see him throw Catapult!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lefty glanced anxiously toward the stanchion,
trying to catch Jack Crawford’s eye. He need
have had no fears, for just then the gate opened
and a large rangy animal was driven in.</p>

<p class='c008'>Shouts of “Catapult! Catapult, do your stuff!”
informed Forest Blakeman that something had
gone amiss.</p>

<p class='c008'>It dawned upon him instantly that Pop Bradshaw
had double crossed him. Despite his anger
he realized that there could be no retreat. To
default would be to make himself ridiculous, and
brand himself a coward. He waved to the crowd
and rode alongside the stanchion.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the bars dropped. Catapult rushed out into
the arena. Partisans of the animal greatly outnumbered
those of the man and cries of, “Throw
him, Catapult,” muffled occasional urgings of,
“Throw him, cowboy!” Blakeman appeared
oblivious of the crowd as he drove home his spurs
and rushed pell mell after the fleeing steer.</p>

<p class='c008'>They traversed nearly the full length of the
arena before the sorrel overtook the steer and
raced him head to head. Then Blakeman shot
through the air in a perfect leap as if hurled from
the saddle by the uncoiling of a gigantic spring.
Headforemost he dived, his body parallel to the
ground. He grasped Catapult’s horns and
brought him to a standstill.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, exerting the last iota of his strength,
Blakeman made a supreme effort to bring the
animal to the ground. Catapult’s head slowly
turned under the tremendous force of the man’s
tensed muscles. But he suddenly snorted and
with a sharp toss of his head, hurled his tormentor
into the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>Blakeman sprawled into soft turf, twenty feet
away. The crowd roared its delight; the air became
thick with sailing sombreros. Lefty and
Alkali laughed until they collapsed weakly
against the fence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And him claimin’ to be a champeen bulldogger!”
Lefty jeered.</p>

<p class='c008'>Blakeman arose unhurt but with a mighty anger
surging through him. Not a dozen paces away
he saw Pop Bradshaw, the man he believed to be
the author of his downfall. Furiously, he advanced
upon the embarrassed rancher.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So you double crossed me!” he said menacingly.
“You’ll pay for this!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I didn’t know anything about it,” whined the
old man.</p>

<p class='c008'>Apparently aware that any violence upon the
person of Pop Bradshaw would only draw the
anger of the crowd, Blakeman turned and limped
away. He was followed by the boos of the throng.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Guess that ought to put a damper on his braggin’
for a while,” Lefty grinned. “I’ll bet Pop
spends the rest of his life wonderin’ how Catapult
got out of the mountain medder too!”</p>

<p class='c008'>His voice died quickly away for the announcer
was calling the next event. It was the bronco
riding contest for girls.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where’s Connie?” Lefty muttered.</p>

<p class='c008'>With one accord he and Alkali turned the
chutes. They saw the girl, white-faced and grim,
perched on the fence, waiting for her turn to ride.</p>

<p class='c008'>The two cowboys crowded close enough to speak
an encouraging word.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good luck, Connie!” grinned Lefty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll need it,” Connie replied with a forced
smile. “I’ve drawn Tanglefoot—the worst bronco
in the lot.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br />A Rescue</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As Lefty and Alkali both knew well, Tanglefoot
was a wild bronco which had brought
the downfall of more than one ambitious rodeo
rider. If Connie were able to handle him she
might win the grand prize, but even the two cowboys
doubted that she had the skill.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie was the fifth rider. Before her there
were three local girls whose riding while good was
not particularly colorful. The fourth contestant,
Enid Bradshaw, by far outpointed her opponents.
She knew she had done well and a satisfied
smile played over her face as she left the arena.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll have to ride as I never did before if I beat
that!” thought Connie.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her turn came next. She mounted Tanglefoot
from the fence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let her go!”</p>

<p class='c008'>As the shout went up, the gate flew open, and
out streaked the roan, landing with a running
buck in the midst of the judges, forcing them to
wheel their horses.</p>

<p class='c008'>A ripple of comment passed over the crowd.
Here was a girl who could ride!</p>

<p class='c008'>Tanglefoot, too, acted as if he were surprised.
For a moment he seemed to be debating the disgrace
of his failure to dislodge his fair rider. Then
the wiry little mustang went into a veritable paroxysm
of bucking.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie never knew that seconds could spin out
to such an interminable length. The horse leaped
into the air, twisting his lithe body like an ancient
equine ancestor trying to shake off a puma or a
jaguar from his back. Down he would come, stiff-legged,
and then rise again into the air as if his
muscles were made of spring steel.</p>

<p class='c008'>From her waist up Connie held her body as relaxed
as possible, at the same time shifting her
weight with lightning-like rapidity to preserve
her balance. Her torso remained vertical to the
ground, regardless of Tanglefoot’s rapid maneuvers.
Waving her hat with her rein-free hand,
the girl kept a graceful seat through it all. Tanglefoot’s
best was not good enough.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie at last heard the timekeeper’s pistol.
The contest was over as far as she was concerned.
She felt that she had acquitted herself well and
she was sure of it when she heard the cheers of the
crowd ringing in her ears.</p>

<p class='c008'>Leaping from Tanglefoot’s saddle to the back
of another horse led by the hazer, she galloped in
triumph from the ring.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was wonderful ridin’,” Lefty told her
proudly, a few minutes later. “If you don’t win
the prize then the judges have been bought off!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie watched anxiously as four other girls
took their turns in the contest. One was thrown
while the other three had drawn horses which did
not require a high degree of skill to ride.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s in the bag, Connie!” whispered Lefty
excitedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>And he was right. A few minutes later the
announcer rode forth to broadcast through his
megaphone that Connie Carl had won first prize
in the riding contest.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Lefty!” the girl cried, fairly overcome by
her good fortune. “Just think! Five hundred
dollars! And maybe I’ll win more before the day
is over.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie had entered her name in a free-for-all
race as well as a roping contest. In the latter
event she placed third, netting a cash award of
fifty dollars. Second prize in the running race
brought her an additional two hundred dollars.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a proud moment for Connie when she
stepped forward to claim her ribbons and a slip of
paper which represented seven hundred and fifty
dollars.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jim Barrows, separating himself from the
crowd, come over to the fence to congratulate the
girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What will you do with so much money?” he
asked jokingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I could use six times as much!” Connie
laughed. “I think I’ll take it home and hide it
under the bed. I know one thing! Not a cent will
be deposited in the First National Bank.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t trust the banker?” smiled the cowboy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He and I don’t feel too friendly toward each
other.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Seriously though, Miss Carl, you’re not thinking
of carrying that money on your person?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why not?” asked Connie quickly. “I’ll cash
the check just before I start for the ranch.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aren’t you afraid someone might rob you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Such a thought had never even occurred to
Connie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There hasn’t been a holdup around here since
the stagecoach stopped running!” she laughed.
“Besides, no one could ever get this money away
from me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jim Barrows said no more, but after chatting
for a few minutes wandered off again. It was the
longest conversation he had ever carried on with
Connie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He really acted as if he were worried about my
money,” the girl thought.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rodeo was drawing to a close and already
many persons were leaving the stands. Connie’s
eye wandered over the crowd. She wondered
what had become of Pop Bradshaw and Enid.
She had not seen the old rancher since the bulldogging
event, nor had the girl appeared to congratulate
her upon winning out in the bronco riding
contest.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In her heart I don’t believe Enid really likes
me,” Connie told herself. “And from now on it
will be harder than ever for us to be friends.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned her attention once more to the arena.
Only one more event remained on the day’s program,
an Indian race.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the opposite side of the track she could see
the ponies being lined up. They were small, sleek,
beautiful animals, so high spirited that their riders
had trouble holding them in position. The Indians
themselves, adorned with bright sashes,
paint and feathers, added a colorful note to the
scene.</p>

<p class='c008'>The start of the race was delayed and the crowd
grew more impatient. An increasing number deserted
the stands, many leaving the bleachers to
crowd against the fence. A portion of it gave
way causing a momentary flurry of excitement.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Back from the track, folks!” warned one of
the guards, but when he moved off a minute
later, the crowd swarmed through the opening
again.</p>

<p class='c008'>No one noticed that a child, separated from its
parents, stood alone just inside the break of the
fence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then at last the starter’s pistol cracked and the
racers were off! Down the track in a cloud of
dust came the ponies, their bareback riders bent
low as they urged their mounts to greater speed.</p>

<p class='c008'>At that moment, the child, unaware of any
danger, started to toddle across the track. Midway
to the other side the little girl saw the oncoming
horses and heard the thundering hoofs. Frozen
by terror she stopped and stood perfectly still.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That child will be killed!” screamed a woman.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before any of the guards could act, Connie slid
down from the fence. The racers were almost at
the grandstand. With no thought for her own
safety, the girl darted out onto the track, directly
in the path of the onrushing horses.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIX' class='c009'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br />Mr. Postil’s Offer</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Connie rushed forward and snatched the
child up in her arms. With the riders bearing
down upon her, she dived head foremost, rolling
over and over at the side of the track. The
horses thundered past, and were lost in a cloud of
dust.</p>

<p class='c008'>The crowd, thrilled by Connie’s act of bravery,
surged forward. In vain the guards sought to
keep the arena clear. Friendly hands seized Connie
and the child, lifting them to their feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>The little girl was crying piteously, but more
from fright than because she had been hurt. Her
only injury was a slight bruise on her arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you all right, Baby?” Connie asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You threw me down in the dirt,” the little girl
said accusingly. “Just look at my pretty dress!
I’m not a baby either!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course you’re not,” agreed Connie soothingly.
“What is your name?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Just at that moment a stout gentleman came
hurrying up. He caught the child in his arms,
hugging her tightly. Without saying a word he
brushed the child’s disheveled hair out of her eyes
and mopped the dirt from her face with his handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t believe she’s hurt, sir,” declared Connie.
“Only shaken up a bit.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The old gentleman seemed too shocked by the
accident to make any reply. Connie started to
move away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, wait, please,” he requested. “You saved
my granddaughter’s life. I must talk with you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anyone would have done the same, sir,” Connie
responded, smiling. “I just happened to be
close to the fence.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I saw it all,” the old man declared. “You
risked your life to save the child. It was magnificent.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, hardly that,” said Connie, flushing with
embarrassment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I didn’t know Doris had wandered away until
I saw her on the track,” the old gentleman went
on. “I was stunned—paralyzed for I thought
surely she would be killed. The child is all I have
in the world.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I quite understand,” Connie murmured.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I haven’t told you my name,” the man said
offering an engraved card. “I am James Postil.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie, after introducing herself, glanced at
the card, noticing that it bore a New York address.
She remarked that Mr. Postil was a long way
from home.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I am spending my vacation in the Southwest,”
he explained. “My granddaughter and I
came out here to live at one of these dude ranches
for a few weeks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope you found a nice place and that you’re
having an enjoyable time,” Connie said pleasantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It hasn’t turned out that way yet. I was looking
for a nice, quiet ranch where Doris could run
wild and grow healthy and strong. Perhaps you’ve
heard of Silverhorn Ranch?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes,” nodded Connie, “only it isn’t really
a ranch at all. Don’t you find it more on the order
of a big tourist hotel?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s it exactly! Something going on from
morning to night. I’ve made up my mind to
move out. But you’re not interested in my difficulties.
Tell me about yourself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There is really nothing to tell,” said Connie
evasively.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are too modest, I fear,” smiled the old
gentleman. “I remember you now. You are the
young lady who won the bronco riding contest.
Come, let’s go somewhere away from the crowd.
I’d like to talk with you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>By this time Connie had gathered that James
Postil was a man of considerable wealth, and she
half suspected that he meant to offer her money
for saving his grandchild. Of course she would
refuse.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Postil seemed to sense the girl’s attitude,
for he led up to the subject very gradually. First
he told her more about himself. The head of a
large manufacturing company in the east, he
found himself at sixty-eight, lonely and alone in
the world save for his one grandchild.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve done my best to raise her up right,” he
told Connie, “but Doris has been too much under
the care of a governess. That’s why I cut loose
this summer and brought her out here. I thought
I’d try to give her a little personal looking-after.
So far the idea hasn’t turned out very well.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll probably find a more satisfactory place
to stay than Silverhorn Ranch, Mr. Postil. I can
understand that it wouldn’t be suitable for Doris
at all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here I am, talking about myself again,” declared
Mr. Postil. “I’ve not given you an opportunity
to tell me a thing about yourself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie had not meant to reveal any of her personal
troubles, but she found the old gentleman a
most sympathetic listener. He interposed a question
here and there and before she knew it he had
learned the entire story of her financial difficulties.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t believe you need to worry any more,”
Mr. Postil said briskly. “How much is your
bank loan?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I didn’t mean——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know you didn’t, young lady,” smiled Mr.
Postil, “but it happens that I owe you a great
debt for saving the life of my grandchild. Doris
means more to me than anything in the world.
Now I’ll be only too happy to give you enough
money——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no,” broke in Connie. “I couldn’t take a
penny.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Call it a loan then.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie was sorely tempted but she shook her
head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I really think I’ll be able to weather the storm
unaided,” she insisted. “With the seven hundred
and fifty dollars I won today, I’ll fix the ranch up
a bit and advertise for summer boarders. Then if
the bank learns I am going ahead in a profitable
way, my note may be extended.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Postil asked Connie many questions about
Rainbow Ranch. With no conscious attempt to
exaggerate she described the wonderful fishing
streams and the lake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We have an extra special attraction, too,” she
added. “The ruins of ancient cliff dwellings. My
father discovered them in the canyon years ago,
and experts say they are in as fine a state of
preservation as any ruins in the Southwest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, you have everything at your ranch,” declared
Mr. Postil enthusiastically. “I’ve been
trying to find just such a place. How about taking
Doris and me as your first paying guests?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, I’d like to have you,” Connie stammered,
“only the ranch house isn’t fixed up. The
food would be plain and there wouldn’t be any
frills.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s exactly what I want,” Mr. Postil insisted.
“I’ll tell you what I’ll do. I’ll finish out
the week at Silverhorn, then Monday morning
I’ll come to your place, and I may be able to round
up a few other guests for you. Here’s a couple
weeks’ board and room money in advance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The old gentleman handed her two bills.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, you’ve given me a hundred dollars!”
Connie protested. “I can’t accept that much.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Take it, take it,” Mr. Postil urged carelessly.
“I’m a very cranky old man and require a lot of
service. You’ll find it will be worth that much
to keep me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie was quite overcome by her good fortune.
She tried to thank Mr. Postil for his generosity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m doing myself the service,” he declared.
“I’ll get busy right away and see if I can’t locate
those friends of mine. If I have any luck I’ll send
you word.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you’ve not even seen the ranch,” Connie
protested. “You may not like it at all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have no worry on that score,” said Mr. Postil
confidently.</p>

<p class='c008'>After he and Doris had walked away, Connie
stood for several minutes with the money held
tightly in her hand. It did not seem possible that
so many wonderful things could have happened
in one day. Yet it was true.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t help but succeed if Mr. Postil brings
his rich friends to the ranch,” she thought excitedly.
“But I’ll need to hire extra household
help and redecorate the bedrooms. Oh, I have
a million things I must do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie wandered about the rodeo ground
searching for Alkali or Lefty. She felt she had
to tell someone about her good fortune, but apparently
both cowboys had drifted away from the
arena.</p>

<p class='c008'>Finally she gave up the search, and presenting
her check at the rodeo office, received cash in the
amount of seven hundred and fifty dollars. Connie
pinned the bills together and fastened the roll
inside her shirt pocket.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was after six o’clock by the time she rode
Silvertail out of the grounds. The streets still
swarmed with people and Red Gulch would be a
lively place until the small hours of the morning.
But Connie was eager to get back home.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sky in the west glowed rosy pink and slowly
darkened. On either side of the lonely road the
limestone cliffs were a blaze of reflected color.
Connie rode slowly, enjoying the twilight.</p>

<p class='c008'>As she cantered along she made her plans.
With eight hundred and fifty dollars she could
remodel the ranch house, hire another Mexican
woman to help Marie, and still have money left.
With even a few paying guests she soon would
have all her debts paid.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie whistled a gay little tune. For the first
time since she had returned home from the East,
she felt entirely happy.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sun dropped below the horizon line and the
distant mountains seemed to cast their dark
shadow over the earth. A chill wind sprang up,
rustling the ragged branches of the gnarled
cedars.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie shivered and drew her jacket more
closely about her. She could feel the cold numbing
her fingers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rainbow Ranch was still many miles away.
The narrow road wound and twisted as it steadily
climbed toward Eagle Pass. Just ahead was a
short tunnel bored in the rock. As they approached
it, Silvertail quivered and pricked up
his ears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the matter, old boy?” Connie asked
softly.</p>

<p class='c008'>She thought someone might be approaching
from the opposite direction but she heard no one.
It had grown so dark that she could not see far
ahead. Yet for some reason Connie shared Silvertail’s
uneasiness.</p>

<p class='c008'>She rode into the tunnel. As the walls closed in
about her, she glanced nervously over her shoulder.
It was as if she could <i>feel</i> a presence. Yet
of course there could be no one in the tunnel.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie breathed easier as she saw a circle of
light ahead. The tunnel had not been longer than
fifty feet yet it had seemed six times that length.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie relaxed in the saddle, and just at that
moment, as she emerged from the tunnel, she
heard a horse nicker from the bushes at the side
of the road.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before she could turn her head to look, a man
rode out in front of her, deliberately blocking the
way. A blue bandana handkerchief had been
pulled high over his mouth, and a revolver dangled
carelessly from his hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pass over the money,” he said in a low, grim
voice. “And don’t try any tricks!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chX' class='c009'>CHAPTER X<br /> <br />The Holdup</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Connie’s first impulse was to spur Silvertail
into a gallop and try to ride by the holdup
man. But an instant’s reflection convinced her
that such a course would be sheer folly. He might
coolly shoot her down.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hurry up and hand over that money!” the
man commanded again.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie was certain she had heard the voice
somewhere before. From the strained manner
in which the man spoke she believed that he was
disguising his normal tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What money?” she asked, stalling for time.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t try to bluff,” retorted the man curtly.
“I know you have it pinned inside your shirt
pocket. Will you give it up or shall I take it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He urged his horse a pace closer. Connie slowly
reached up as if to unpin the roll of money. But
the thought of handing over her earnings was
more than she could bear.</p>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly, throwing caution to the wind, she
spurred her horse. Silvertail lunged forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>The holdup man laughed harshly as he seized
the horse’s bridle bringing him up so sharply that
Connie was nearly unseated.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no you don’t!” he said.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie felt the cold muzzle of a revolver press
against her side. Her determination to save the
money at all cost ebbed quickly away. She reached
up and unpinned the roll of money.</p>

<p class='c008'>The holdup man jerked it from her hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now dismount!” he commanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie hesitated and then slowly obeyed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The masked man gave Silvertail a sharp clip
with his quirt which sent the horse racing down
the road. Then with a mock bow to Connie, he
wheeled his own pony, and disappeared into the
brush. For several minutes the girl could hear the
thud of hoofs and then all was quiet.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie stood in the middle of the road, too
stunned to move. Every penny of the money she
had won at the rodeo was gone! And likewise lost
was the hundred dollars given her by Mr. Postil as
an advance on his board and room.</p>

<p class='c008'>After a moment Connie started on down the
road. She had a long, discouraging walk ahead of
her for the nearest habitation was Slocer’s Ranch,
a full mile away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is the cruelest thing that ever happened,”
Connie told herself bitterly as she trudged along.
“All my hopes ended!”</p>

<p class='c008'>A half hour later she pounded on the door of
the Slocer ranch house. Connie knew the owners
well although she had not seen them since her return
from the East. They were two bachelor
brothers who worked the ranch in partnership.</p>

<p class='c008'>George Slocer, a man with a bushy red beard,
opened the door. For a moment he did not recognize
Connie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“May I use your telephone?” she asked quickly.
“It’s terribly important.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, if it isn’t Connie Carl!” exclaimed the
rancher. “Come right in. You didn’t walk all
the way here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, from Eagle Pass! I was held up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie related what had occurred. Then she
telephoned the sheriff’s office in Red Gulch, asking
him to send a posse at once to search for the man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll saddle up and do a little huntin’ ourselves,”
George Slocer promised. “That’s the
lowest trick I ever heard tell about. Stealing a
gal’s money!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t believe there’s a chance of catching
the man now,” Connie said glumly. “He’s had a
good half hour’s start.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you get a look at him?” the rancher asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not really. It was so dark and he kept the
handkerchief over his face.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Didn’t recognize the hoss?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, it was a dark pony about Silvertail’s size.
I’m sure it must have been some man who knew
me because he disguised his voice.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Likely someone who knew you were carrying
the money on your person. Do you remember
tellin’ anyone you were cashin’ the check?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, no—” Connie said, and then recalled
that she had spoken to Jim Barrows. He had
warned her that she was acting unwisely, but she
had taken his advice lightly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Several persons were standing near when I
cashed the check at the rodeo office,” she ended,
“but I don’t remember anyone in particular.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I reckon your money is gone, Connie,” the
rancher admitted, buckling on his gun belt. “But
there’s a chance the sheriff may catch the fellow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Slocer brothers loaned the girl a horse so
that she might ride on to Rainbow Ranch while
they went to join the sheriff’s posse.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Connie finally rode into the courtyard
Marie came running out to meet her. The Mexican
girl was relieved to see her young mistress, for
some minutes before Silvertail had galloped up
to the gate without a rider.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I’m glad Silvertail came home,” Connie
said in relief. “But I thought he would.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She told Marie what had happened and asked
if the cowboys had returned from Red Gulch. No
one was back.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie took the borrowed horse to the barn and
unsaddled him. Then, feeling discouraged and
fairly ill, she went to her own room. Marie rapped
a few minutes later and brought in a tray of food
and a hot drink.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are so kind, Marie,” Connie said gratefully.
“Perhaps food will make me feel better.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She had eaten no lunch or supper, yet she did
not feel hungry. But rather than disappoint the
Mexican girl, she made a pretense of enjoying the
food.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What am I to do now?” Connie thought when
she was alone once more. “Mr. Postil arrives
Monday and nothing will be ready for him. I’ve
accepted his money so I can’t turn him away, yet
for two weeks he’ll be a financial liability rather
than an asset.”</p>

<p class='c008'>After tossing for more than an hour on her pillow
the girl at last fell asleep. She was so exhausted
that she did not awaken until morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie went downstairs to learn that news of
her misfortune had preceded her. The cowboys
came to offer their sympathy. Later in the morning
George Slocer rode in to report that the
sheriff’s posse had been unable to find a trace of
the holdup man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, the money is gone all right,” Connie said
gloomily. “Perhaps it served me right for carrying
so much on my person.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She was leaning dejectedly against the corral
bars when Lefty came to talk with her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish there was somethin’ we could do to help
you,” he said.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie hesitated and then without looking directly
at Lefty replied quickly:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hate to ask this, Lefty, but I know you
picked up a tidy bit of money yesterday at the
rodeo. Would you lend it to me for a few weeks?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I sure would, Connie, if I had any left,” the
cowboy answered. “I’m plumb ashamed to tell
you but me and Alkali did a little celebratin’.
We’re both busted flat.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That seems to be a common ailment around
Rainbow Ranch,” Connie said ruefully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why don’t you ask Jim Barrows?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I wouldn’t do that,” Connie replied
quickly. “Besides, he hasn’t any money.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re wrong there, Connie. I saw him
countin’ a big roll this morning in the bunk house.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know where he’d get it,” Connie said,
frowning thoughtfully. “He was stony broke
when he came here, and he’s not even received his
wages since then. What do you think of Jim,
Lefty?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I guess he’s all right. He minds his own
business and that’s somethin’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I like him too,” said Connie. “Lefty, I’m
thinking of giving you and Jim new jobs. I suppose
you’ve heard about my idea to turn this place
into a dude ranch?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yeh, I did hear somethin’ about it, but I figgered
you wouldn’t do anything rash like that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t believe it’s a rash idea at all,” Connie
said, smiling. “If I hadn’t been held up everything
would have worked out beautifully. But
now I’m in the business whether I like it or not.
My first prize dude arrives Monday, and there
may be others.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s this new job?” Lefty asked uneasily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You and Jim are to wrangle the dudes—if we
snare any. I thought you could take Mr. Postil
riding and fishing. And we’ll plan special little
over-night camping trips—anything to keep folks
entertained.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here, Connie,” Lefty began to protest,
but his voice trailed off as Forest Blakeman swung
into view.</p>

<p class='c008'>The foreman, still smarting from his recent
humiliation at the rodeo, was in a bad mood.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You might do a little work, Lefty, instead of
loafing around all morning,” he said curtly. “Get
those calves watered.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’re already watered,” Lefty muttered but
he moved away from the corral.</p>

<p class='c008'>The foreman turned to Connie, making no attempt
to disguise his annoyance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A nice mess we’re in now, Miss Connie! It
seems to me you might have consulted me before
you decided to turn this place into a dude ranch!
Just how do you think we’ll be able to feed and
entertain a house full of guests when we can’t even
pay our regular help?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Everything would have turned out all right if
only I hadn’t been robbed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aren’t you forgetting that the sixteenth of the
month isn’t far away?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I’m beaten,” Connie acknowledged. “I
realize that. There’s no chance my money will
ever be recovered.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The foreman was silent for a moment. Then he
said in a lowered tone:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t suppose it ever occurred to you to question
Jim Barrows?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“To question him? About his personal affairs?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’d bear investigation all right,” Blakeman
replied grimly. “But I wasn’t referring to
that. I meant about what he was doing yesterday
and where he got that big roll of money.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose at the rodeo——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s what <i>he</i> claims,” Blakeman said
shortly. “I have a different opinion.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just what are you trying to suggest?” Connie
asked. “I know you’ve never liked Jim Barrows.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That has nothing to do with it. But there’s
no use trying to convince you he’s bad medicine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you have the slightest evidence against him
I’ll certainly listen to it,” Connie replied coldly.
“What do you think the man has done?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The foreman looked quickly about to make certain
no one was within hearing distance. Then he
said tersely:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jim Barrows is a sneak and a crook! He was
the masked man who held you up at Eagle Pass!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXI' class='c009'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br />Wrangling Dudes</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“That is a very dangerous statement to make
unless you have proof,” Connie replied
gravely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jim Barrows’ bank roll is proof enough for
me,” the foreman answered gruffly. “He knew you
were carrying the prize money home with you,
didn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” admitted Connie reluctantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And where was he last night? No one saw
him in town. He came back to the ranch about
four o’clock this morning. His horse was just
about done up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The idea sounds ridiculous to me,” Connie
said scoffingly. “I think you’re inclined to be
entirely too suspicious, Mr. Blakeman.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right,” retorted the foreman with a shrug.
“I knew you wouldn’t believe me. But don’t say
later that I didn’t warn you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>After Blakeman had walked away, Connie
stood for a long while gazing off toward the distant
mountains. She knew perfectly well that
the foreman bore Jim Barrows a grudge and
would enjoy seeing him involved in trouble. For
that reason she largely discounted his words.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet the accusation he had made served to arouse
a certain distrust in her mind. Little things which
had seemed insignificant before now took on
greater importance.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was true, as Blakeman had said, that Jim
Barrows knew she intended to carry the rodeo
prize money on her person. His sudden acquisition
of a bank roll did seem rather strange. She
was almost sure the man had been without funds
when he first came to Rainbow Ranch.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Connie mulled the matter over in her mind,
she saw Jim Barrows emerge from the bunk house
and walk toward the barn. She was tempted to
summon him, but could not quite bring herself
to do it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The idea is ridiculous!” she told herself again.
“I’ll not think any more about it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But Connie found that it was not easy to dismiss
the matter from her mind. She caught herself
studying the cowboy and pondering Forest Blakeman’s
words.</p>

<p class='c008'>Late afternoon brought a message from Mr.
Postil in the form of a telegram sent out from Red
Gulch.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Expect three more guests Monday,” it read.
“W. P. Grimes, son Cecil, and daughter Helena,
arriving with me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie scarcely knew whether to feel elated or
dismayed. But at least the message served to
shake her from the lethargy into which she had
fallen.</p>

<p class='c008'>She promptly set Marie to work cleaning and
preparing the guest chambers. The rooms were
pleasant enough but they were barren. There
were so many things needed—curtains, rugs and
linen.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m going to town now to buy supplies,” Connie
told the servant. “I’ll just have to get credit,
that’s all. And I’ll try to find another woman to
help you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At the dry goods store in Red Gulch, the girl
made her selections. As the owner wrapped up
the package, he remarked casually:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, so you’re going into the dude business?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Only in a very small way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Reckon the fever’s struck everyone around
here,” the storekeeper went on. “Hear your
neighbor’s going to try it too.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My neighbor?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure, Pop Bradshaw. He’s fixing up the
ranch and planning on quite a number of city
folks spending the summer there. They say he’s
going to build a swimming pool.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Things like that cost money,” Connie said
gravely. “I didn’t know Pop had it to spend.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, he’s just the front so they say. I hear that
the banker is behind the deal.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The news filled Connie with deep resentment.
It seemed unjust to her that the bank, while refusing
to grant an extension to her loan, would
risk a large amount in trying to develop Pop
Bradshaw’s run-down ranch.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was offended, too, because Enid had told
her nothing about the proposed plan.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sometimes I feel as if I haven’t a true friend
in this community,” Connie thought bitterly. “As
for Mr. Haynes, I believe he deliberately planned
to get my ranch. And the worst is that he’ll undoubtedly
succeed!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Back at Rainbow Ranch the girl called Lefty
and Jim Barrows to tell them about their new
duties.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In the morning you must be on hand to greet
the guests when they arrive,” she declared. “I’ll
appoint you two to keep them happy and satisfied.
And now we may as well take a ride over your
route.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Route?” demanded Lefty. “Are we supposed
to run a milk wagon too?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s this way,” explained Connie. “The guests
probably will wish to ride. Either you or Jim
must escort them, and I’d like to have you give
an interesting little talk about the different places
of interest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jim here is the one to do that,” Lefty insisted.
“He’s the handsome boy and he has style. He
could give the ladies a lot of good poses a-settin’
on his steed and a-pointin’ off dreamy-like into
space.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll make a good stage cowboy yourself
when you get used to the idea,” Connie laughed.
“Come on, let’s ride up to the lake.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The three riders passed along a narrow trail
which led through a dense wood of cedar trees.
The path soon became steep and narrow, causing
the horses to labor as they climbed single file toward
the summit. Upon reaching the top of the
hill, Connie dismounted, and throwing the reins
to the ground, said to her companions:</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is Lover’s Leap.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s <i>what</i>?” demanded Lefty incredulously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It used to be Conner’s Lake but from now on
we’re calling it Lover’s Leap,” Connie chuckled.
“Didn’t you ever hear the story about how a
beautiful Indian princess jumped off here and lost
her life when her beloved warrior married another
squaw?”</p>

<p class='c008'>A grin spread over Lefty’s face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, sure, I get the idea,” he said. “Atmosphere.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The lake doesn’t really need any build-up,”
Connie declared. “Our guests will not find a more
beautiful spot anywhere in New Mexico.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As she spoke, Connie moved nearer the edge
of the cliff. The opposite side of the hill top
sheered off into a perpendicular wall of rock
nearly sixty feet high. At the base of the declivity
was a small pool of deep blue water. Beyond, the
hill sloped gently away into the wooded valley.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d be careful, Miss,” warned Jim Barrows uneasily.
“It must be seventy feet down to that
lake.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not quite so far,” replied Connie, moving back
from the cliff. “But it’s a long drop.”</p>

<p class='c008'>After viewing the scene for a few minutes the
three riders mounted again and rode down to a
fork in the trail.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This path leads to the cliff dwellings,” Connie
explained for Jim Barrow’s benefit. “There are
two trails, but for an inexperienced rider this one
is best.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Alkali was telling me about those cliff ruins,”
Jim Barrows remarked. “Your father discovered
them years ago, didn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, and they’re in an almost perfect state of
preservation. Dad had some excavation done and
cut away brush. If you’ve never been over we
might go now. I could spend hours there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve seen Blakeman over this way a lot,” Barrows
commented as they started down the trail.
“I reckon he’s interested in such things.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not that I ever heard,” laughed Connie.
“Blakeman’s hobbies aren’t so very cultural, I
fear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He was probably over this way lookin’ for a
stray cow,” Lefty contributed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The trail wound down into the valley and then
ascended at a steep angle. A little farther on,
Connie halted her horse so that Jim Barrows
might view the cliff dwellings from this particular
point.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course you know the cliff people were
widely distributed throughout the Southwest in
prehistoric times,” she remarked. “The most
noted of their ruins are at Mesa Verde, the national
park, but I think ours are just as interesting
if they’re not so large.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What was the idea of building their homes up
under the lip of the cliff?” the cowboy asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, that was for protection against their
enemies,” Connie explained. “Then too, it gave
them shelter from the cold. As we go farther
you’ll find that the cliff dwellers used many devices
to guard the entrances of their homes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It takes an acrobat to get to the place,” Lefty
added. “On the other trail you have to go through
a narrow tunnel.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“This route is much easier,” Connie said, “but
we’ll do a little fancy climbing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She urged her horse on again and for a time
they rode single file, circling the cliffs as they ascended
higher. Presently, tying their steeds to
a tree, they continued afoot.</p>

<p class='c008'>By means of a knotted rope, Connie swung herself
down to the lower level of the cliff.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The old cliff dwellers didn’t need ladders to
get up and down as we do,” she told Barrows,
pointing out toe holds which had been chipped in
the rock. “They climbed like flies.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The three companions now stood on a shelf of
rock and earth. Back beneath the lip of the cliff
were visible the geometrical ruins of square
granaries, round towers and oblong rooms cut
with tiny windows and doors. Connie told Barrows
that seven different families once had occupied
the site.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How do you know?” he inquired curiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, by the number of <i>kivas</i>,” she declared.
“Here, I’ll show you what I mean.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She pointed out a deep, circular hole in the earth
which had been roofed over. It was large enough
to have held perhaps twenty or thirty people.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A <i>kiva</i> such as this was used for ceremonial
purposes only,” she explained, “but each little
tribe or family had its own. There is a great deal
of lore connected with them but I’ll not bore you
with that. Would you like to go down into it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How would I get out again?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, one of the other <i>kivas</i> has a ladder. Dad
put it in years ago.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s take a look at it then,” Barrows agreed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie crossed over to another <i>kiva</i> which had
been hidden from view by a high wall.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, where is the ladder?” she asked in surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Looks like someone has swiped it,” Lefty declared
peering down into the dark opening. “I’ll
have to make another before our dude season gets
in full swing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We could let you down on a rope if you’d like
to see the inside,” Connie offered. “But there’s
nothing down there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll not bother this time,” the man returned.
“It’s getting late anyway.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” agreed Connie, quickly, “we really
should be getting back to the ranch.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They retraced their way, finding themselves
winded by the time they reached the horses.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s funny about that ladder,” Lefty muttered
as they started down the trail. “I’d like to know
who swiped it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Presently they swung back into the path leading
from Lover’s Leap and Connie pointed out a
site which would be excellent for picnics.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ve really given a lot of thought to this
dude ranch business, haven’t you?” Jim Barrows
asked soberly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” Connie acknowledged; “it seems to me
we have wonderful attractions here. A dude
ranch has been one of my dreams. A silly one,
I’m afraid.”</p>

<p class='c008'>To hide her emotion, she quickly rode on down
the trail. Presently she reined in to indicate a
large cliff across the ravine. At this hour of sunset
it was a shimmering wall of color.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Echo Cliff,” she said softly. “Be sure to point
it out to our dudes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, you sure have picked up a lot of fancy
names,” Lefty complained good naturedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They are the names I gave these places when
I was a child. I was a great one to pretend, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will the rock really echo?” asked Jim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Listen!” commanded Connie.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cupping her hands to her mouth she gave a
long, clear cry which came back not once but
several times.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, that’s a real echo!” Lefty exclaimed. “In
all the years I been workin’ here I never knew you
could get an echo like that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe I’ll be able to teach you a few things
about this ranch,” Connie laughed. “I know and
love every rock and stone here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you lose the place,” said Lefty, “it will be a
rotten shame.”</p>

<p class='c008'>No sooner were the words spoken than he regretted
them. Connie’s smile faded and a tired
look came over her face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” she replied.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then, pulling her jacket more closely about
her throat, she added: “It’s getting chilly. Let’s
be going home.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <br />An Argument</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the excitement of preparing for the expected
guests Connie forgot entirely Forest
Blakeman’s warning concerning Jim Barrows.
She had meant to question him about his activities
on the day of the rodeo but somehow the opportunity
never presented itself. She did not believe
that he could have had anything to do with the
holdup at Eagle Pass.</p>

<p class='c008'>Early Monday morning a high powered limousine
drove into the courtyard, bringing Mr. Postil,
his small granddaughter, and the Grimes family.
The latter consisted of F. P. Grimes, a distinguished
railroad official, his son Cecil, and
daughter, Helena.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie and the cowboys were on hand to greet
the guests and to make them welcome. Helena,
who appeared to be about eighteen, was a pretty,
dark haired girl, dressed in a modish white suit.
She gazed about with undisguised distaste as she
alighted from the car.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t think I shall like this place at all,” Connie
heard her say to her father. “Why, it’s nothing
but a run-down cattle farm.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Cecil, several years older than his sister, looked
equally pained as he gazed about the courtyard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My man,” he said, addressing Lefty in a condescending
tone, “will you be good enough to show
me to my room?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just follow me,” Lefty replied gruffly. “Our
butler ain’t workin’ today.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Postil and Mr. Grimes, apparently old
friends, lingered in the courtyard for a few minutes
while Connie took Helena to her bedchamber.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Only one room?” the girl asked in surprise.
“And no private bath?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m afraid not,” Connie said politely. “This
isn’t a very luxurious place, of course. It’s merely
a ranch.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can see that,” Helena murmured dryly.</p>

<p class='c008'>A flush of anger spread over Connie’s face.
Offering no reply she quickly left the girl alone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wrangling dudes isn’t going to be quite as
great a pleasure as I expected,” she thought
grimly. “I’ve never seen such a spoiled girl in all
my life. And Cecil is just like her, too!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie found it a relief to talk with Mr. Grimes
and Mr. Postil. They both seemed well pleased
with Rainbow Ranch and assured her that they
would not mind a few inconveniences.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It will do my son and daughter good to rough
it for a few weeks,” the railroad man declared.
“Life has always been too easy for them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie quite agreed with Mr. Grimes before
the day was ended. Helena spent nearly all of
her time sulking while Cecil annoyed the cowboys
by asking ridiculous questions and trying to let
them know that he considered them as menials
whose sole function was to serve him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If this is a sample of the dudes I’m to herd,
I’m quittin’ right now,” Lefty complained to Connie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, you wouldn’t let me down at a time like
this,” she said quickly. “Mr. Postil is fine and for
that matter, so is Mr. Grimes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Old Grimes ain’t so bad,” the cowboy admitted.
“He broke down and told me he’s plannin’
to make a regular he-man out of that son of
his. If that ain’t a laugh!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You be nice to Cecil, Lefty. Remember, he’s
a paying guest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I’ll treat him gentle unless he ‘my mans’
me again. Then I’m liable to give him a good poke
in the nose!”</p>

<p class='c008'>With the ranch undermanned, and the new arrivals
demanding constant service, Connie found
herself hard pressed to keep the household running
smoothly. It seemed to her that Forest
Blakeman had lain down on his job completely.
He made it increasingly clear that he was not in
sympathy with her plan of trying to run a dude
ranch.</p>

<p class='c008'>However, for some reason which was not clear
to Connie, Blakeman singled Helena out, and
wasted hours chatting with her. The girl kept the
other cowboys from their work too, assuming that
it was their duty to keep her entertained.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s just nothing to do around here,” she
complained to Connie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps you’d like to ride,” Connie suggested.
“I’ll have Alkali saddle up a pony for you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s do go for a canter,” proposed Cecil who
had come up behind the girls. “I was looking
over the horses just now. There’s one that’s not
bad—the others are nags.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie smiled as she followed the brother and
sister to the barn. She felt quite certain that
neither of them had ever done much riding. It
therefore took her by surprise when she learned
that the horse which Cecil had chosen for his own
was none other than Silvertail.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I reckon you’ll like Star a lot better, sir,”
Alkali told the boy persuasively. “Silvertail belongs
to Miss Connie, and no one rides him but
her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Cecil gazed disdainfully at Star, a beautiful
roan.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If I can’t have a horse of my own choosing then
I’ll not ride,” he said peevishly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Saddle Silvertail for him, Alkali,” Connie instructed
quietly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cowboy did as he was told, noting as the
young man mounted that he was stiff and awkward.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You better handle Silvertail easy,” he warned.
“That hoss is high-spirited.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Alkali, you ride along with them,” Connie directed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We don’t need a guide,” Helena said quickly.
“Not unless that other young man is free.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The foreman?” Connie inquired. “I’m afraid
he isn’t. If you wish I’ll go with you——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll ride alone,” interrupted Helena rudely.
“Come along, Cecil.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie and Alkali watched the two ride away.
Helena evidently had taken lessons in the East for
she sat her horse well, but her brother bounced
high in the saddle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That conceited coot will ruin Silvertail’s gait,”
Alkali muttered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I only hope Cecil isn’t thrown,” Connie replied
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It would serve him right to get pitched into a
cactus plant—but he’s too lucky for that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie turned her eyes away from the riders,
for just then a car drove into the courtyard. It
was Lefty returning from Red Gulch where he
had gone for supplies, but the girl was surprised
to see two middle-aged women with him.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cowboy climbed out over the car door and
came hurrying toward Connie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, I dragged home two more dudes,” he reported
in a whisper. “Found ’em at the postoffice.
They was inquirin’ for a place to stay, so
I gave ’em a long line about Rainbow. They’re
schoolmarms.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lefty, you’re a genius!” Connie laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>She hastened to the car to greet the newcomers.
They were pleasant women, spinsters who hailed
from Elkhart, Indiana. This was their first trip
West and they assured Connie they were enjoying
every minute of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is such a lovely ranch,” Miss Gladwin
declared enthusiastically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, isn’t it,” echoed Miss Parker. “And so
Mexican! I love the atmosphere.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie’s spirits soared. She had become so accustomed
to complaints during the past day, that
she had begun to think nothing about Rainbow
Ranch was right. It was a pleasure to meet two
dudes who were not difficult to please.</p>

<p class='c008'>The teachers were delighted with their bedrooms.
They confessed to Connie that they had
never ridden horseback, but were dying to try it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll take a trip to Lover’s Leap tomorrow,”
Connie promised. “And perhaps to the cliff
dwellings.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hearing the sound of clattering hoofs in the
courtyard, the girl excused herself and hurried
outside. Silvertail, minus a rider, was wandering
aimlessly about near the corrals. Before Connie
could reach the horse, Alkali came running from
the barn and caught his bridle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cecil must have been thrown!” Connie gasped.
“Oh, I hope he’s not badly hurt.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Alkali said nothing but a look of smug satisfaction
came over his face.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie mounted Silvertail and rode out to learn
what had happened. She had not gone far when
she saw Helena approaching on horseback with
Cecil trudging along beside her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m so glad you’re not injured,” Connie said
in relief as she drew rein.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s not your fault that I’m not!” the youth
snapped. “Why didn’t you warn me the horse
was vicious?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Silvertail isn’t vicious,” Connie replied. “But
we did try to tell you that he has to be properly
handled.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was your own fault, Cecil,” said Helena
with a shrug. “Why don’t you learn to ride?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie dismounted, offering to let the youth
take her place while she walked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d not ride that horse again for a hundred
dollars!” Cecil snapped. “And it’s fortunate for
you that I wasn’t injured.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As Connie expected, the young man made a distorted
report of the incident to his father that
evening. Mr. Grimes did not take the affair very
seriously.</p>

<p class='c008'>However, the conversation was overheard by
the two teachers. Inclined to be nervous, they
immediately jumped to the conclusion that all of
the horses at Rainbow Ranch were unsafe. It required
the combined efforts of Connie, Alkali,
Lefty and Jim Barrows to convince them otherwise.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even then they were decidedly uneasy over the
proposed trip to Lover’s Leap and the cliff dwellings.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you quite certain this beast isn’t an outlaw?”
Miss Parker asked Lefty timidly as he led
up her pony the next morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ma’am, this hoss was raised on milk,” the cowboy
assured her. “She’s so lazy she won’t even
swish flies.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie was hopeful that Cecil would not be a
member of the party, but at the last minute both he
and his sister decided to make the trip. Mr.
Grimes and Mr. Postil, had planned a fishing trip
to a nearby lake with Alkali serving as guide.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll go first to Lover’s Leap and then to the
cliff dwellings,” Connie announced.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What a silly name—Lover’s Leap,” Cecil
scoffed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lefty rode at the head of the party while Connie
brought up the rear. Progress along the trail
necessarily was slow for the two teachers could
ride comfortably only at a walk. However, they
enjoyed the scenery and Connie liked to answer
their questions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cecil was annoyed by the slow pace and made
frequent complaints about the heat. Nothing
interested him save his own discomfort.</p>

<p class='c008'>The party stopped for lunch at Echo Canyon
where Lefty opened the packages of food packed
by Marie and boiled coffee over an open fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope there’s really something worth seeing
at the end of this trail,” Cecil grumbled as they
started on once more.</p>

<p class='c008'>A little later they approached the summit of
the steep incline. There Lefty halted the party.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We dismount here and walk the rest of the
way, folks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What?” demanded Cecil. “Up that mountain?
Why can’t we ride?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s not room at the top to tie so many
horses,” Connie explained.</p>

<p class='c008'>Everyone dismounted and Lefty fastened the
ponies to a tree. Then they started the tedious
climb afoot. The two teachers, both plump and
short of breath, were very cheerful about it. When
they reached the summit and peered over the cliff
at the pool below, they declared they had not seen
such a beautiful spot anywhere on their vacation
trip.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s well worth the climb,” Miss Parker asserted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So far as I can see, it’s just a lake,” said Cecil
irritably. “And a pretty dinky one at that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie told the story of the Indian princess who
had leaped to her death. The teachers were awed
by the tale, asking if it were really true.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course it isn’t,” answered Cecil before Connie
could speak. “You hear that same story
everywhere. About how far down is the lake?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A little over sixty feet,” Lefty replied briefly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Looks about half that distance to me,” Cecil
said speculatively. “I guess out West here they
have to exaggerate everything or it wouldn’t make
a good story.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It really is that far down,” Connie told him.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was growing irritated with Cecil, and Lefty
too was having difficulty in holding his temper.
The spoiled young man had no right to ruin the
trip for the other members of the party, yet that
was exactly what he was doing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Once years ago I dived off here and I thought
I’d never reach the water,” Connie went on. “I
did it on a dare.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You jumped from this cliff?” Cecil asked incredulously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” Connie admitted, “but it was a silly
thing to do. I’ll never try it again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Cecil remained silent but the expression on his
face disclosed that he doubted the girl’s story.
Somewhat nettled, Connie said quietly to Helena
and the teachers:</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you care to step over this way I’ll show you
another pretty view of the valley. On a clear day
you can see the cliff dwellings from here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The three women followed her a short distance
away. Lefty and Cecil were left alone at the edge
of the cliff. Connie paid no heed to them until
a few minutes later when she was startled by the
sound of their voices. The men were arguing in
loud, angry tones.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s the last crack I’ll take from you,” she
heard Lefty say in a deadly drawl. “Now it’s
your turn to take one from me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>His fist shot out, connecting squarely under
Cecil’s jaw. It was not a hard blow, but the young
man staggered backwards. He stumbled over a
stone and the soft rock gave way beneath his feet.
Lefty darted forward to save him, but he was too
late.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a terrified shriek Cecil tumbled headlong
over the precipice.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <br />Over the Precipice</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Cecil’s panic-stricken cry was muffled by a
resounding splash as his body struck the pool
below.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My brother will drown!” screamed Helena
hysterically. “He can’t swim a stroke!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie had rushed to the edge of the cliff.
Jerking off her riding boots, she poised for an
instant on the brow of the declivity. Then she
shot out into space head foremost, turning slowly
in mid-air so that she broke the water with the
lower part of her body. The force of the fall sent
her deep into the pool and even her heavy clothing
did not protect her from the stinging lash of the
blow.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two powerful strokes brought her to the surface.
Cecil was almost within arm’s reach, sputtering
and wildly thrashing the water.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie whipped an arm about his chest and
towed him to the edge of the pool. She climbed
out on a low ledge of rock and pulled him up after
her. For a few minutes Cecil sputtered water like
a lawn sprinkler. Then instead of thanking Connie
for saving him he said wrathfully:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall report this to my father. He’ll have
that cowboy of yours arrested!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know what came over Lefty,” Connie
said soothingly. “He’s usually very even tempered.
You must have said something which
angered him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Cecil avoided the girl’s glance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The fellow tried to drown me,” he snapped.
“But he’ll pay for it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lefty didn’t mean to push you over the precipice,
I am sure of that,” replied Connie.
“You slipped on the rock, and then it crumbled.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose you’ll not even discharge him for
this?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I haven’t thought that far,” answered Connie
quietly. “Let’s not discuss it now. We’ll both
catch our deaths if we sit around in these wet
clothes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m so bruised and battered I can’t walk,”
Cecil complained.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re lucky no bones are broken,” Connie
told him and added impishly: “it really is a sixty
foot drop.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This time Cecil did not dispute her word. He
followed her sullenly as she went ahead and parted
the bushes.</p>

<p class='c008'>They climbed from the pool-basin and circled
the hill until they struck a trail. This led them
back toward Lover’s Leap but they had not gone
far before they met Lefty and the three women.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Cecil, are you all right?” called his sister.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m still alive,” the young man muttered.
“No thanks to that brute!” He glared at Lefty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cecil,” the cowboy said anxiously, “I hope you
don’t think I pushed you off that steep cliff
a-purpose.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no,” replied the youth mockingly. “I suppose
you were just being playful! An old western
custom no doubt.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was an accident, and I’m mighty sorry,”
Lefty said contritely. “Maybe I owe you an
apology, and I’m makin’ it now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll accept no apology from you,” retorted
Cecil. “You’ll be reported to the authorities.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie shot Lefty a glance which warned him
to say nothing more.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s talk about it after we get back to the
ranch,” she said. “We’ll have to postpone our
visit to the cliff dwellings until later.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll get the horses,” Lefty declared.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We may as well all walk along with you,” replied
Connie. “Cecil and I will freeze if we stand
here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lefty tried to put his jacket around Connie
but she passed it on to Cecil. He took it most
ungallantly, and Miss Parker then stripped off
her light sweater, insisting that the girl wear it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cecil, I think you might thank Miss Carl for
saving your life,” Helena reminded her brother.
“It was a pretty brave thing to do—jumping off
that cliff after you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I did thank her,” Cecil replied.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had said no word of appreciation to Connie,
but the girl expected none. If only he could be
induced to forget the incident, that was all she
asked. Somehow she must keep him from reporting
the matter to the authorities.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the party trudged along the trail, Lefty
dropped back to walk with Connie. “I guess I’ve
messed things up pretty thoroughly now,” he said
gloomily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, you have, Lefty. Why did you strike
him? It was inexcusable.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I just couldn’t help myself, Connie. That
fellow has been gettin’ under my skin ever since
he came here. He just pulled one crack too many
and I saw red.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What did he say to you, Lefty?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I don’t just remember.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Was it about me, Lefty?” Connie pinned him
down. “Tell me the truth.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, yes, it was,” Lefty admitted reluctantly.
“He made a remark I didn’t like—intimatin’ that
everything you said was just a lot of apple sauce.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was very gallant of you to go to my defense.
But I hardly think Cecil’s remark called for such
drastic action.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was the way he said it. And I’ve stood a
lot from him, Connie. I just lost my head that’s
all. I’ll pack up my duds as soon as I get back to
the bunk house.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have I asked you to do that, Lefty?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, but this places you in a bad spot. The
only thing for me to do is to get out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want you to stay, Lefty. Why, I couldn’t
run the ranch without you. Sometimes I feel
you’re the only person I can entirely trust.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve let you in for a heap of trouble, Connie.
When old man Grimes hears what I did to that
sweetheart son of his, he’ll make things hard for
you. If I get out of the way he might not be quite
so tough.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not afraid of Mr. Grimes, Lefty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe not, but his money comes in mighty
useful,” Lefty answered dryly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie knew that the cowboy was entirely right.
It was a foregone conclusion that Cecil would give
an exaggerated report of the incident to his father.
The least she could expect would be that Mr.
Grimes and his spoiled brood would depart, taking
with them Mr. Postil, his small daughter, and
perhaps the two teachers. Nor could she greatly
blame anyone for leaving.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie came out of her reverie as she heard
Cecil, who was far ahead, shout something back.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now what’s the matter with him?” muttered
Lefty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where are our horses?” called the youth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie and Lefty quickened their pace. When
they came within view of the cedars where the
ponies had been tied, they stopped short in amazement.
The horses were gone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now what!” exclaimed Connie.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although they could see where the ponies had
nibbled at the tree branches and trampled the
ground, but there was no sign of the animals.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is just another evidence of gross carelessness!”
said Cecil angrily. “The horses weren’t
tied well and they’ve run off.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lefty’s face grew very red but he managed to
control his temper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It isn’t logical that six horses would break
away at the same time,” Connie said quietly.
“Besides, I’m sure they were well tied.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, they’re gone,” said Cecil sullenly. “You
can see that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How did they get away?” inquired Miss
Parker.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know,” admitted Connie soberly.</p>

<p class='c008'>She met Lefty’s gaze. Someone deliberately
had turned the horses loose. They were certain of
that.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cowboy bent down to examine the soft
earth. It was impossible to tell if there were alien
footprints by the cedars for Cecil and the girls
had tramped everywhere.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now what are we going to do?” demanded
Cecil. “I’m freezing to death if that means anything
to you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How far are we from the ranch?” asked one of
the teachers anxiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Over two miles,” Connie replied. “I’m afraid
we’ll have to walk back.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Walk?” Cecil cried furiously. “In these wet
clothes? This is absolutely the last straw.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“First we’ll build a fire and dry you out,” Connie
said. “Lefty, see if you can find some wood.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The teachers tried to help the cowboy, but
neither Helena nor her brother would so much as
pick up a stick. Cecil’s temper sweetened a trifle
after he had warmed himself by the big bonfire.
But he took keen pleasure in showing Helena
bruised marks on his skin. It did not seem to occur
to him that Connie too might be in discomfort.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girl drew Lefty aside to discuss the situation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Someone set those horses free deliberately,”
Connie said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure, they never walked away themselves.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who could have done it, Lefty?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The cowboy shook his head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It might have been some smart Mexican kid,”
he said finally.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you know what I believe?” Connie asked.
“Someone is afraid I’ll make a success of this dude
ranch. It looks to me as if that trick was done for
the deliberate purpose of making the guests
leave.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pop Bradshaw is trying to start up in the dude
business,” Lefty said thoughtfully. “Maybe he
got wind of how we smuggled Catapult into the
rodeo grounds. I know Blakeman’s been makin’
it plenty tough for him ever since.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pop wouldn’t do a thing like this,” Connie replied
slowly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We didn’t think he’d double-cross his friends
either. But he did. Maybe he’s aimin’ to get
your dudes away from you, Connie.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If they’re all like Cecil he’s welcome to them,”
answered Connie wearily.</p>

<p class='c008'>The party began the long trek back to the ranch.
Lefty and Connie, accustomed to walking, did
not mind the rough trail, but the others found it
trying. Helena had not worn suitable shoes.
Her complaints were nearly as annoying as those
of her brother.</p>

<p class='c008'>At first the school teachers tried to be cheerful
but soon they gave up the effort. And then to
add to the difficulties, Miss Parker twisted her
ankle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t think I can walk another step,” she
murmured. “Oh, dear, why did we ever come on
this horrible trip?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s only one thing to do,” Connie decided.
“Lefty, you go on ahead to the ranch and come
back with some horses. We’ll have a long wait
here, but it’s the best that can be done.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll get back just as soon as I can,” the cowboy
promised.</p>

<p class='c008'>He started down the trail but had gone only a
few feet when he halted. Emerging from among
the trees was a lone rider leading a string of horses.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s Jim Barrows!” shouted Lefty, waving his
hat. “And he has our ponies!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIV' class='c009'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <br />A Telltale Handkerchief</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Good old Jim!” murmured Connie gratefully
as she saw the rider coming up the trail.
“He’s saved our lives.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lefty hurried down the path to meet the man
and help him with the horses.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Everything all right?” asked Jim as he rode
up. “I was worried when I found your ponies on
the trail. I thought you knew how to tie a rope,
Lefty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ignoring the thrust, the cowboy asked quickly:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where did you find the hosses, Jim?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Down the trail about half a mile. Couldn’t
figure how they all broke away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They didn’t break loose,” Lefty answered
grimly. “Someone untied ’em a-purpose. You
didn’t see anyone on the trail?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jim Barrows shook his head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How did you happen to be over this way yourself?”
Lefty asked curiously. “I thought you
were wranglin’ steers for Blakeman today.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jim Barrow’s eyes narrowed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re not hintin’ I turned those horses
loose——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now don’t get touchy, Jim,” Lefty said
quickly. “’Course I wasn’t hintin’ at anything
like that. I just asked a civil question.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I came over this way today because I thought
something might go wrong.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your bones sort of told you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I had a feeling. And it turns out I was
right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lefty made no reply as he followed Jim up the
trail, but he studied the man intently.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie had not heard the talk between the two
cowboys. She greeted Jim warmly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What happened to you, Miss Connie?” he
asked in astonishment, observing her bedraggled
appearance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, we had a little accident,” she answered
vaguely. “We’re certainly grateful to you, Jim,
for bringing our horses.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The man dismounted and helped the school
teachers into the saddle. Unnoticed by all save
Connie, a blue bandanna handkerchief dropped
from his pocket. She thought that he would pick
it up, but after the other members of the party had
started down the trail, he rode after them, leaving
the handkerchief lying on the ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Connie rode past the spot, she reached low
and swept it up. She would not have given it a
second glance save that it reminded her of the
handkerchief which the masked bandit had worn
the night he robbed her of her rodeo earnings.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was nothing unusual about a blue bandanna,
however, for many cowboys carried them.
Yet as Connie folded the bit of cloth she noticed
that two initials had been stamped in one corner.
But they were not the letters which the girl might
have expected to see.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘J. R.’,” she mused, “that doesn’t seem right.
Jim’s last name doesn’t begin with an ‘R.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie carefully examined the letters again to
make certain that she had not mistaken a “B” for
an “R.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s an ‘R’ all right,” she decided. “Why
should Jim be carrying a handkerchief marked
like this unless he’s passing under an assumed
name?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie had intended to return the handkerchief
to the man, but now she thrust it into her pocket,
and when she rode alongside a few minutes later,
made no mention of finding it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girl did not know what to think. It was
possible, of course, that Jim had come into possession
of another person’s handkerchief and was
using it as his own. But that did not seem probable.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps Blakeman was right about the man,”
Connie reflected. “From the very first he believed
that Jim had a past.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Upon reaching the ranch, Cecil immediately
inquired for his father. Learning that Mr.
Grimes had not returned from the fishing trip, he
disappeared to his room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie changed her own clothing and then went
to talk with Forest Blakeman. He had heard the
story of the mishap from Helena, a version which
strongly favored her brother.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I take it you’re discharging Lefty?” the foreman
inquired.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” Connie replied, “he acted rashly, but it
wasn’t entirely his fault. Cecil had the ducking
coming to him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you’ll excuse me for saying it, you’re making
a mess of this ranch,” Blakeman told her
bluntly. “I was against this dude idea from the
first, but since you brought guests here, I don’t
believe in cooking up damage suits.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cecil wasn’t hurt.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He may claim differently. Miss Connie, the
best thing you can do is to sell this ranch before the
bank takes it over.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know of anyone who would buy it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If your price was right I might be able to find
you a buyer,” Blakeman said quickly. “But you
couldn’t expect any fancy figure.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who is your prospect?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I’m not at liberty to say. But if you’d
take, say five thousand dollars, I think I could
swing the deal. That would pay off your bank
note and give you something clear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“This ranch is worth three times that amount at
least,” Connie replied. “I’ll never sell unless I’m
compelled to do it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you wait very long you’ll miss your chance,”
Blakeman warned. “The bank may sell you out,
and then you’ll get even less.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie made no reply but turned away. She
had seen Jim Barrows crossing the courtyard
and wished to talk with him. The foreman followed
her gaze.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you’d give me a free hand I’d send that fellow
on his way,” he declared.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you know about Jim Barrows?” Connie
questioned, pausing again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I told you what I thought of him the other
day. They’re saying in town that you’ve taken a
fugitive from justice to shelter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who said a thing like that?” Connie asked
sharply.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, it’s common talk. If you weren’t so
blind you could see for yourself that he’s not a
square shooter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t really have any evidence against
him?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t prove that he’s wanted by the law—no.
But I do know he’s no hand for us. Why, today,
he was supposed to be wrangling steers, and he
walked off from the job.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was lucky for me that he did,” Connie said
ruefully. “But I think I’ll have a talk with him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t expect him to break down and tell you
his life history,” Blakeman said with a trace of
sarcasm. “He won’t do it. The only thing I’d
tell him would be to get out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie did not answer. After the foreman had
gone to the barn she stood by the corrals lost in
thought. She did not know what she could say to
Jim Barrows. Perhaps she might return the
handkerchief and ask him to explain the initials.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie had seen the man disappear into the
bunk house and she knew that the other cowboys
were busy elsewhere. This would be her opportunity
to talk with him alone.</p>

<p class='c008'>She walked slowly toward the bunk house,
dreading the interview. The door was half ajar.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Connie paused, hesitating to rap, she saw
Jim Barrows move across the room. He had not
heard her approach. There was something about
his manner which struck Connie as odd. Instead
of rapping on the door, she waited and watched.</p>

<p class='c008'>Barrows glanced out the window toward the
barn, and then he crossed over to a battered chest
which stood near Blakeman’s bunk. The box belonged
to the foreman, Connie knew, for she had
heard Lefty joking about how Blakeman always
kept his love letters locked in it.</p>

<p class='c008'>To the girl’s amazement, Barrows took a handful
of keys from his pocket. He selected one and
fitted it into the lock.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie had seen quite enough. She pushed
open the door of the bunk house.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jim Barrows whirled about and his hand went
instinctively to his hip pocket. Connie noted the
gesture and her lips tightened.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, it’s you, is it?” the man laughed, relaxing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You were afraid it was Blakeman,” Connie
replied coldly. “Jim Barrows, may I ask what
you are doing?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess you can see for yourself, Miss. I was
trying to open this chest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Forest Blakeman’s chest,” Connie supplied.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I reckon you’re right.” Jim Barrows grinned
arrogantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why were you trying to open his chest?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I just had a sudden itch to find out what
was inside. Prying into things is a weakness of
mine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It seems to be,” Connie answered scornfully.
“Jim Barrows, there are a number of things which
you might explain.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She took the blue handkerchief from her pocket,
offering it to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You dropped this on the trail and I picked it
up,” she told him. “Is it yours?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It must be if you saw me drop it,” he returned
amiably.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This may seem very amusing to you, but I
don’t see anything funny about it,” Connie said,
her anger rising. “This handkerchief happens
to be marked with the initials ‘J. R.’ Perhaps
you can explain that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The expression of the man’s face changed. He
took the handkerchief from Connie, staring at the
telltale markings.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Barrows isn’t your real name, is it?” Connie
demanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” the man admitted after a long hesitation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then tell me what it is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t do that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re wanted by the law!” Connie accused.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do I look like a criminal?” the man countered,
a faint smile playing over his lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I believe you’ve been acting a part ever since
you came here!” Connie went on indignantly.
“That day I found you on the trail—I don’t believe
you were sick at all. You pretended you
were broke and out of work, but I notice you have
plenty of money now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are very observing,” the man replied very
quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve been very blind.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll set your mind at rest upon one point. I
am not a fugitive from the law.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then why are you using a name other than
your own?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have a very good reason—one which I cannot
reveal.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“For all I know you may be the man who held
me up at Eagle Pass,” Connie continued heatedly.
“That’s what Blakeman tried to tell me——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, so you’ve been listening to him?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“By your own admission you have good reason
not to use your true name.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And it is a <i>good</i> reason,” the man returned
with emphasis. “Connie, I want you to promise
that you’ll not say anything to Blakeman about
this.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why should I protect you? You’ve given me
no explanation for trying to break into his chest.
In fact——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie’s voice trailed off for just at that moment
Lefty appeared in the doorway. He looked
quickly from one to the other. But he gave no
indication that he had overheard the conversation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Connie,” he said significantly, “Mr. Grimes
has been talking with Cecil. He wants to see you
right away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll come,” said the girl wearily.</p>

<p class='c008'>She faced Jim Barrows once more. “There
are still several things I wish to say to you,” she
told him gravely. “We’ll finish our conversation
after I have seen Mr. Grimes.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXV' class='c009'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <br />An Unpleasant Revelation</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Connie walked slowly toward the ranch
house, inwardly bracing herself for an unpleasant
interview with Mr. Grimes. She found
the old gentleman awaiting her on the veranda.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know why you wish to see me,” she said
quickly before he could speak. “I can’t tell you
how sorry I am about what happened this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You risked your life to pull my son from the
lake, young lady. I wish to thank you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie was taken completely by surprise. Mr.
Grimes did not look in the least angry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, didn’t Cecil tell you——” she began.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes, my son said a number of things about
this fellow called Lefty, but I finally got the true
story out of him. He probably deserved the ducking.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie could scarcely believe that she had heard
correctly. She had been expecting a severe rebuke.
Her surprise was heightened as the old
gentleman continued:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cecil has become a difficult problem of late.
I dare say a few such experiences might serve to
take some of the conceit out of the boy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you’re not angry?” Connie gasped.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Grimes glanced quickly about to make certain
that no one was within hearing distance of
his voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Quite the contrary,” he declared. “I wish I
had been there to see it myself. We’ll just consider
the incident closed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s very generous of you, Mr. Grimes,”
Connie said gratefully. “Will you be staying
on?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, indeed. I’m thoroughly enjoying ranch
life. And I think it may have a beneficial effect
upon both Cecil and Helena.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie felt as if a great load had been lifted
from her shoulders. After talking with Mr.
Grimes for a few minutes she went back toward
the bunk house. Meeting Lefty she paused to tell
him the good news.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The old gent is a real man,” the cowboy declared
admiringly. “Too bad his son can’t be
more like him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, it is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe a ducking a day would do him good
just like the old man said.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps, but don’t you try it,” Connie warned
with a laugh. “From now on you’re to keep out
of Cecil’s way as much as possible.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t worry,” Lefty rejoined, “I don’t have
any hankerin’ for that sissy’s company.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie returned to the bunk house to resume
her talk with Jim Barrows. Now that she had
thought the matter over she decided there could be
only one course open to her. Unless the man made
a satisfactory explanation for his strange actions
she must discharge him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie knocked on the door and, when there
was no answer, pushed it open. The room was
deserted.</p>

<p class='c008'>She glanced toward the bunk occupied by Barrows.
It was neatly made up but an Indian
blanket, which the cowboy had bought from Lefty,
was gone. Jim’s meager belongings likewise were
missing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lefty!” Connie called.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cowboy came quickly toward the bunk
house.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s wrong?” he asked in surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think Barrows has skipped out, Lefty. At
least his things are gone. Did you see him leave?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, no, Connie. He was here the last I
knew.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s see if he’s taken one of the horses.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They ran to the barn. One glance assured them
that instead of a pony, Jim Barrows had appropriated
the ranch car.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That fellow certainly had his nerve!” Lefty
exclaimed angrily. “What’s the big idea anyway?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m afraid he was a crook,” Connie admitted
ruefully. “My suspicions were aroused and I
made the mistake of letting him know. Now we’re
minus a car.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll ride in to Red Gulch right away and report
to the sheriff,” Lefty promised.</p>

<p class='c008'>After he had gone, Connie wandered back to
the bunk house. Thinking that Barrows might
have appropriated other property which did not
belong to him, she made an inspection. Nothing
seemed to have been taken. More from curiosity
than for any other reason she tried the lid of Forest
Blakeman’s chest. It was still locked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder what he does keep inside?” she
mused.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well?” asked a sharp voice behind her.</p>

<p class='c008'>Startled, Connie whirled around to see Forest
Blakeman standing in the doorway. She laughed
in confusion, realizing that the man easily might
misinterpret her action.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was just looking about——” she began, but
Blakeman cut her short.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So I observe. You seem to be interested in my
personal belongings.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie flushed at the accusation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope you don’t think I was trying to break
into your chest,” she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Blakeman, I don’t understand you at all.
I came here because I wished to see if Jim Barrows
had taken anything from the bunk house. He
went off a few minutes ago in the car after we had
a rather unpleasant talk together.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The foreman’s countenance underwent a swift
change.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Barrows has gone for good?” he questioned.
“Well, I’m glad you discharged him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Apparently I was wrong about him and you
were right,” Connie admitted ruefully. “He stole
the ranch car. I don’t know what we’ll do without
one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you notified the sheriff?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lefty went to Red Gulch to do it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe it’s just as well not to press the matter,”
the foreman said thoughtfully. “We’re rid
of Barrows and that’s something.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That doesn’t bring the car back—or my money
if he really did take it. Somehow it’s hard to believe——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now don’t start cooking up sentiment over
that worthless fellow,” Blakeman interrupted
quickly. “You have enough troubles without
worrying over him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re quite right there, Mr. Blakeman.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The foreman hesitated, and then asked with an
abrupt change of tone: “Have you been thinking
over what I said the other day about selling
the ranch?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve been thinking, but my answer is still the
same. I’ll never sell unless I’m compelled to do
it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is the eleventh,” the foreman reminded
her. “Have you talked with the banker lately?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m going in to Red Gulch tomorrow. I suppose
I’ll have to come to some decision after I’ve
seen Mr. Haynes again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, let me know,” Blakeman nodded, as
Connie walked slowly away.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was after nine o’clock that evening when a
familiar car came up the lane to the ranch house.
Hearing the sound of the motor, Connie ran outside.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, Lefty!” she cried in delight as the car
stopped with a jerk. “You found our automobile!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The cowboy climbed out and started to untie his
horse which he had led on a long rope behind the
vehicle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Barrows didn’t skip off with it after all,” he
told Connie. “I found the car in front of the drug
store at Red Gulch.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you see Jim?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I couldn’t find him anywhere in town. I
reckon he abandoned the car and maybe hopped a
freight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie asked Lefty if he had talked with the
sheriff.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, but you know Old Daniels,” the cowboy
replied. “He’s lazy as they come. Said he
couldn’t do nothin’ unless there was a warrant for
Barrows’ arrest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not sure I want to get out a warrant,”
Connie returned slowly. “I have no real evidence
against him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s what I figured,” Lefty nodded. “So
I reckon there’s no more to be done.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In the morning Cecil and Helena complained
that they had not yet seen the cliff dwellings. Before
Connie could assign either Lefty or Alkali
to escort them, the foreman volunteered to serve
as guide. While the arrangement did not please
Connie she could not protest for Helena immediately
accepted Blakeman’s offer.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the three had ridden away, she took advantage
of their absence to drive in to Red Gulch.
Upon presenting herself at the bank she was admitted
to Mr. Haynes’ private office.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good morning, Miss Carl,” he said pleasantly.
“Have a chair.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie sat down, feeling very ill at ease. Mr.
Haynes was watching her shrewdly. Already she
suspected that it would be useless to make another
request for an extension to her note.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hesitantly, she explained her plan to launch
forth into a dude ranch.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have seven paying guests now,” she declared,
“and within a few weeks I hope to increase the
number. I’m sure I’ll be able to pay off the loan in
another three months.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Carl, I admire your determination,” replied
the banker, “but I must think about my depositors.
I regret to say we cannot renew your
note.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie arose, pushing back her chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You refuse to give me a chance,” she said
bitterly. “And I know the reason! From the
first you have schemed to take over the ranch.
Through Pop Bradshaw you plan to gain control
of the best land in the county!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re quite wrong, Miss Carl,” the banker
answered quietly. “This rumor that we are taking
over the Bradshaw place and running it as a
dude ranch is quite unfounded. I have no idea
who is behind the idea, but the financing has not
gone through this bank.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sorry I lost my temper,” Connie apologized.
“I’ll try to get the money by the sixteenth.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned quickly and walked from the room.
As she opened the door, a tall man who had been
standing at the writing desk near the private office
partition, ducked his head and slipped out the side
door of the bank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, that looked like Jim Barrows!” Connie
thought.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whoever it was, she believed that he had been
listening to her conversation with Mr. Haynes.
The walls were thin and she had not taken care to
lower her voice. Undoubtedly, the man had heard
every word.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie darted to the door. She looked up and
down the street. The man was nowhere to be
seen.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It <i>was</i> Jim Barrows,” she told herself. “He
didn’t want me to see him—that’s why he ran
away.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVI' class='c009'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <br />The Roundup</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Connie spent a half hour searching the
streets for the man, and finally abandoned
the hunt. It was early afternoon by the time she
reached Rainbow Ranch. Lefty met her by the
corral gate.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, how did the guests like the cliff dwellings?”
she inquired cheerfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Blakeman never took ’em there,” the cowboy
reported. “Instead they went for a ride down to
the Rainbow River.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But there’s nothing to see on that trail!” Connie
exclaimed. “It’s just a tiresome, dusty ride!
Why didn’t he take the party to the cliffs as he was
supposed to do?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Guess he wanted to be contrary,” Lefty replied.
“He never has cottoned to this dude idea.
Can you stand some more bad news, Connie?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve had so much already, I’m getting hardened
to it. What is it this time? You didn’t
pitch Cecil in the lake again?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, he’s been real decent to me ever since that
duckin’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is the bad news, Lefty?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The two school marms left a few minutes ago.
They took their luggage and went just as soon
as they got back from the Rainbow River trip.
Miss Parker told me to give this to you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He offered a check which was made out for the
exact amount owed by the women.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I thought they intended to stay at least
two weeks more,” Connie murmured, staring at
the check. “Maybe they didn’t like the trip.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was part of it,” Lefty agreed. “They
came in lookin’ pretty hot and bothered.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you know where they went?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, to the Bradshaw Ranch. Said they had
heard it was a lot better place.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Someone has been talking with them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Looks like it all right. Pop had the nerve to
come for them himself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s no friend of mine any more,” Connie said
indignantly. “I wish I had been here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It wouldn’t have done any good.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I suppose not,” Connie sighed. “I talked
with the banker today, Lefty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What did he say?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, you might know he refused to extend my
note. All the way home I tried to think what I
could do. Unless I sell there’s only one way out.
I’ll have a big roundup and dispose of every Longhorn
I own. What do you think of the idea?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lefty was silently chewing a blade of grass.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ve been losin’ money on cattle ever since
Blakeman took over the ranch,” he said slowly.
“I think it’s a smart thing to do, Connie.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then I’ll talk with Blakeman right now,” the
girl declared. “There’s no time to be lost. We’ll
start the roundup tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Before broaching the subject to the foreman
Connie asked the man for an explanation of why
he had taken the party of dudes to the Rainbow
River instead of the cliff dwellings.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I figured it would prove more entertainin’ to
them,” he replied with a shrug.</p>

<p class='c008'>“After this I wish you would carry out my
orders, Mr. Blakeman. But I’ll say no more
about it. I’d like your opinion now on another
matter—I’m planning a big roundup.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She went on to tell of her idea, and was surprised
when the foreman offered opposition.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You couldn’t sell your cattle at a worse time,”
he insisted. “And how do you aim to round up the
herd without more riders? You’ve kept Alkali
and Lefty pretty well tied up with the dudes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll let the guests help with the roundup,”
Connie declared gaily. “It should prove an exciting
experience for them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A lot of help they’d be. Especially Cecil.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anyway, it will be a means of keeping them
entertained. As for riders, we might get a few
from the Slocer Ranch. Some of their cows will
be mixed with ours and they’ll probably want to do
their own cutting-out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A roundup would take a couple of days,” the
foreman frowned. “Some of the cows have
strayed into the canyons. It will be a hard job to
round them all up. How will you feed the men?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll get out Dad’s old chuck wagon,” Connie
said, her eyes dancing. “It hasn’t been used in
years, but it will be fun to see it roll once more!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And will you have Marie do the cooking?” the
foreman inquired sarcastically.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie shook her head, refusing to take offense.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll borrow Cookie from the Bar R Ranch
and run everything in the grand old style. It
should be a real roundup.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s what I’d like to see,” boomed a hearty
voice behind them. “A roundup!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie turned to see Mr. Postil who had come
up with his small granddaughter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll certainly have an opportunity, Mr.
Postil, if you don’t mind riding a horse,” Connie
laughed. “I’m going to start rounding up all my
cattle tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And will you brand them?” asked the little
girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Only a few of the calves which I may keep,”
Connie answered. “Branding isn’t as necessary
as it was at one time, now that most of the free
range is gone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve not been in a saddle for twenty years,”
Mr. Postil declared, “but if you have a nice gentle
horse I might try it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We have just the one for you,” Connie promised.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m going too,” said the little girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll let you ride in the chuck wagon with
Cookie,” Connie laughed. “Then you’ll be perfectly
safe.”</p>

<p class='c008'>News of the coming roundup spread swiftly.
Somewhat to the surprise of everyone, Cecil and
Helena both showed interest, and Mr. Grimes said
he would not miss it for anything.</p>

<p class='c008'>Immensely cheered, Connie got out the car and
drove to the Slocer Ranch to ask the owners if
she might borrow a few of their punchers for the
big drive.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can let you have two of the boys,” George
Slocer promised. “We’re short handed ourselves
or I could give you more help.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll get along all right with that number,”
Connie said. “That will give me five dependable
men.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her next call was at the Bar R Ranch. In passing
Pop Bradshaw’s place, Connie saw the two
teachers and Enid sitting on the front veranda.
She pretended not to see them. Putting on a
burst of speed she drove past, her eyes glued on
the ribbon of road.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie was cordially received at the Bar R.
Cookie, the old colored man, who had flipped flapjacks
in many a chuck wagon, grinned from ear to
ear when he learned that his culinary services were
needed for a roundup.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie took him with her to Red Gulch, there
to select his own supplies for the trip. It was long
after supper before they returned to Rainbow
Ranch with the car loaded. However, the girl
could not think of sleep, for many things remained
to be done.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll have to get the chuck wagon up from the
field,” she told Cookie. “I’ll see about it now
while you start unloading the car.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie looked about for one of the men, but
Lefty and Alkali were both busy pitching hay to
the horses.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you seen Blakeman?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He was around here a minute or two ago,”
said Alkali.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie went to the bunk house but she could
not find the foreman.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, well, I’ll get the chuck wagon myself,” she
decided. “It will be easier than waiting for someone
else to do it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She went back to the barn for one of the work
horses and harness. The chuck wagon had been
left in the south field and she was relieved to find
that standing in the weather had not damaged it.
Hitching up, she towed it back to the ranch house.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Connie closed the gate behind her, she was
surprised to observe Cecil and Helena mounting
horses.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you going for a ride?” she asked as they
came up. “It is a pretty night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re on our way to see those famous cliff
dwellings by moonlight,” Helena declared. “Ever
since we arrived you’ve been promising us a close
glimpse of them. We’ve decided to do our own
exploring.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, but it’s so late to start out for the cliffs,”
Connie protested. “And it isn’t safe for you to
go alone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nonsense,” replied Helena impatiently.
“We’re not children.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s very easy to become lost on the trail. Besides,
if you’re taking part in the roundup you
really should get some sleep. We’ll have a hard
day tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You sound just like a Granny,” Helena
laughed. “Cecil and I know how to take care of
ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on, Helena,” urged the boy impatiently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you’re really determined to go, I’m going
too,” Connie said quietly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you’ll have to catch up with us,” Helena
replied, digging her heels into her steed’s ribs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie hurriedly turned the chuck wagon over
to Cookie, and saddling Silvertail, set off in pursuit
of the boy and girl. She felt irritated beyond
measure. It did not seem to matter to them at all
how much trouble they caused. If left to themselves
they would be sure to take a wrong turn in
the trail.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie soon overtook the reckless pair. She
had very little to say as the horses clattered over
the stony road.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was truly a beautiful night and soon Connie,
falling under the spell of the big moon, could bear
no resentment. Often when she was a child she
and her father had visited the cliffs upon just such
an evening. The recollection of the remarkable
sight had lingered long in her memory.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie selected the South trail because it would
give the best view of the cliff dwellings as they
descended into the valley and climbed again to the
other side. Emerging from a screen of pines, she
reined in her horse and waited for Helena and
Cecil who had fallen behind.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a sweep of her arm she pointed across the
canyon. In the moonlight the white rocks shone
weirdly, and the dark squares, each one marking
the prehistoric dwelling place of an ancient tribe,
looked like somber eyes peering across the valley.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, it’s beautiful,” Helena murmured.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even Cecil was deeply impressed by the sight.
For a long moment no one spoke.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Connie sat up very straight as she saw
something move along the face of the cliff opposite
them. For just an instant she thought that it
might be a wild animal but the next moment she
clearly distinguished the form of a man. He crept
along the cliff trail, making his way toward an
opening in the rocks.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who’s there?” Connie shouted across the
chasm.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no answer. With head bent low, the
man fled into the dense bushes which lined the
narrow trail.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <br />A Night Prowler</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Who was that fellow?” Cecil asked in a
frightened whisper. “Why did he run
when you called?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know,” the girl answered. “We’ll find
out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She urged Silvertail down the steep trail.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wait,” protested Cecil in alarm. “We’re unarmed,
and there’s no telling who that man may
be. Maybe we ought to call off this trip.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You and Helena ride back to the ranch,” Connie
urged. “I’m going over there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then we’ll stay with you,” declared Helena
with surprising courage. “After all, this was
our idea.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The horses picked their way slowly and cautiously
down the steep path. Soon they reached
the bottom of the canyon and began the ascent.
Connie kept her eyes on the trail above them which
circled the cliff. She had seen no sign of anyone
moving about.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let your horse have his head,” she warned as
the way became more treacherous.</p>

<p class='c008'>Presently Connie called a halt. They tied their
steeds to a pine tree and continued afoot. The
trail became dangerously narrow, so that a slight
misstep would mean a plunge over the sheer precipice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s not go any farther,” Helena gasped.
“I’m afraid.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You and Cecil wait for me here,” Connie commanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>Leaving the pair huddling with their backs to
the cliff, she hurried on down the trail. Connie
knew every inch of it and had no fear of falling.
But she glanced sharply at the overhanging
bushes. Everything was still. Yet the girl had
a feeling that her movements were being observed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Using the crude steps which had been cut in the
cliff by the ancient dwellers, Connie descended
between two faulted rocks. As she picked up the
trail again at the bottom, she saw something bright
and shiny lying on the ground. It was a tiny silver
knife.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a murmur of astonishment she reached
down for it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, that looks like Jim Barrows’ knife,” she
thought as she examined it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie remembered that the man had worn an
ornamental silver knife fastened to his watch
chain. Her reflection was a brief one for as she
fingered the article, Helena gave a piercing
scream.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fearing that harm had befallen the girl, Connie
thrust the knife into her pocket and scrambled
up the cliff by means of toe holds cut there by
the ancient dwellers. She ran along the trail until
she caught sight of Cecil and Helena standing
where she had left them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, you’re all right, thank goodness,” she
gasped. “When I heard that scream I was frightened
nearly out of my wits.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I saw someone moving in the bushes!” Helena
reported.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Helena pointed to a group of shrubs some distance
above them. Connie knew that it would be
impossible to reach the spot without a dangerous
climb. Unarmed, she had no desire to investigate.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s get away from here,” Cecil urged. “You
can’t hope to learn the identity of that prowler.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie did not mention that already she had
gained an important clue. She felt certain the
knife belonged to Jim Barrows. But why would
he be investigating the cliff dwellings? Was it
possible that he was living in one of the <i>kivas</i>,
hiding there in fear that the law would overtake
him?</p>

<p class='c008'>She hesitated, wondering if she ought not to go
back and make a thorough search. Helena read
her thought and grasped her by the hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do let’s go away from here,” she pleaded.
“Cecil and I were wrong about wishing to come
in the first place. Please don’t go back into that
dark hole under the cliff. Something dreadful
might happen.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right, we’ll return to the ranch,” Connie
said. “I doubt that we could learn anything to-night
anyway.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who do you think was hiding in those bushes?”
Cecil asked nervously as they mounted their
horses.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, perhaps a cowboy from Slocer’s Ranch,”
Connie replied carelessly. “One of the boys might
have come over here just to see the cliff dwellings
by moonlight. Nearly every cowboy has a sentimental
streak, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hadn’t observed it,” Helena responded
dryly. “It doesn’t seem to me the man would
have run away unless he were afraid of being
recognized.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie did not trust herself to offer any comment
as they began the descent into the valley.
The discovery that Jim Barrows was lurking in
the vicinity disturbed her more than she cared to
have Cecil and Helena know.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the most part the three rode in silence. The
incident of the night had served to sober Helena
and her brother and they had lost their superior
airs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ascending the trail on the far side of the canyon,
they turned their horses toward Rainbow Ranch.
Connie was dead tired but a great many things
remained to be done before she could feel free to
turn in.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t forget that the roundup starts tomorrow
at daybreak,” she called to Cecil and Helena as the
couple dismounted and walked toward the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll be up,” Helena promised.</p>

<p class='c008'>During Connie’s absence Cookie had nearly
finished loading the chuck wagon. The girl helped
him complete the task and then went to talk with
Lefty regarding details of the next day’s work.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Has Blakeman returned yet?” she questioned.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, he hasn’t,” Lefty admitted. “This is a
fine night for him to streak off somewhere.
Leavin’ all the work. Connie, I reckon you know
your own business, but if you ask me, Blakeman
ain’t never had your best interests to heart.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know he’s opposed to this roundup.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He sure is, Connie. That’s why he’s layin’
down on the job.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I owe Blakeman money,” Connie said slowly.
“If it weren’t for that I’d let him go now, but as it
is my hands are tied.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure, I can see how it is,” Lefty admitted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie started to turn away, and then abruptly
halted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Lefty,” she said, “I wish you’d be particularly
alert during the roundup. I happen to
know that Jim Barrows is keeping close to the
ranch, and I’m afraid he may try to make trouble.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jim Barrows?” the cowboy asked in surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I saw him tonight, or at least I think I did,”
Connie replied, and went on to tell how she had
picked up the silver knife on the trail near the
cliff dwellings.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lefty examined the knife carefully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s his all right,” he said. “Wonder what
Jim was doing around there?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I mean to find out as soon as we get this
roundup off our hands, Lefty. But remember,
keep a sharp watch tomorrow. We can’t afford
to have anything go wrong.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll be on my guard,” the cowboy promised.
“And I’ll tip Alkali off too.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Despite her great weariness, Connie awoke the
next morning feeling completely refreshed. At
the first sign of dawn she was down at the corrals
helping rope horses. Besides those required for
the guests, each rider would need two extras.</p>

<p class='c008'>At four-thirty the cowboys from the Slocer
Ranch galloped into the courtyard, announcing
themselves ready for the big drive. The foreman
assigned them to their duties and with Lefty and
Alkali they rode off again.</p>

<p class='c008'>By five o’clock the chuck wagon was on its way.
Mr. Grimes, Mr. Postil and the little girl went
with Cookie. Helena and Cecil chose to follow
on horseback.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie knew that the dudes would prove more
of a handicap than an aid in the roundup, but she
was pleased to see how much interest everyone was
taking. Most amazing to her was the change of
attitude shown by Helena and Cecil. The pair
actually seemed eager to win her approval.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the chuck wagon established in a temporary camp,
Connie rode away to cover the eastern
portion of the range. For several hours she kept
to the saddle, rounding up every stray steer. Far
to the southward she could see a great cloud of
dust which meant that Alkali and Lefty, who
covered that section, had their herd on the move.
The Slocer boys would be slower for they were
searching the canyons.</p>

<p class='c008'>Irrespective of brand Connie rounded up every
steer she could find. Nearly all bore the mark of
the Rainbow outfit, but there were a few strays belonging
to the Slocers and Pop Bradshaw.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was nearly sundown before Connie could
drive her steers to the knoll where the other cattle
grazed. Alkali and the Slocer boys were riding
through the herd cutting out those which did not
bear the Rainbow brand.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie went to the chuck wagon for a cup of
hot coffee and a dish of steaming stew. It was the
first food she had tasted since morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You look all done in,” observed Lefty who
had thrown himself on the ground for a few minutes’
rest.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I’m all right,” Connie declared. “It’s been
a wonderful drive! I had no idea I owned so many
steers. If I get anything like a fair price, I’ll be
able to pay my debts and have a tidy sum left.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You ought to go back to the ranch and get
some sleep tonight,” Lefty advised. “We can
hold the herd without you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps I will after supper,” Connie agreed.
“Are the dudes having a good time?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Old man Grimes said he enjoyed every minute
of it,” Lefty reported, pouring himself another
cup of coffee. “He and Mr. Postil took the kid
and went back to the ranch a few minutes ago.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie could see Helena and Cecil riding with
Forest Blakeman, evidently under the impression
that they were helping him keep the herd under
control. While she was eating they came up to the
chuck wagon, flushed and excited.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, it’s been wonderful!” declared Helena excitedly.
“I’d not have missed it for anything in
the world. Cecil and I are staying tonight to help
hold the herd.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s fine,” replied Connie—“we need
riders.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She avoided looking at Lefty who had a pained
expression on his face. Presently the cowboy arose,
and saddling a fresh pony, rode out to relieve
Alkali.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cookie soon had a hearty supper ready and both
Cecil and Helena did justice to it, making no complaint
at the rough fare. They did not notice that
both Connie and Alkali kept glancing at the
slowly darkening sky.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Looks like a storm blowin’ up,” the cowboy
presently remarked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” agreed Connie. “And the cattle seem
to be growing more restless. We may need more
riders before morning. I’m staying, of course.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is there any danger of a stampede?” Cecil
asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Reckon it would give you a real thrill to see
one,” Alkali commented dryly. “Well, maybe
you’ll get your chance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>After supper while Helena and Cecil sat around
the campfire, Connie rode slowly around the herd.
The cattle seemed fairly quiet. A few animals
were on their feet but most of them were lying
down. Lefty’s discordant voice could be heard
singing an old cowboy song.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie rode over to talk with him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How does the weather look to you, Lefty?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not so good,” he admitted, squinting up at the
moving clouds overhead. “We’ll have rain before
morning. I wish we had a few extra men.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The cattle seem to be quiet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure, they are now, but there’s something in
the air, Connie. You can feel it. When the storm
breaks, I’ll be plumb surprised if they don’t start
rattlin’ their hocks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie went back to the campfire knowing that
it was wise to get as much rest as possible. She
warned Cecil and his sister that a storm was coming,
but both elected to remain. They spread out
their bed tarps near the chuck wagon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie fell asleep almost at once, but in a short
while she was awake again. The air had grown
cold. It was pitch dark.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie arose and tossed a log on the fire. She
could not see the herd to the southward but she
heard the rumble of hoofs. The steers were on the
move again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I ought to be getting out there,” Connie
thought. “There’s going to be trouble a-plenty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Cookie had left the coffee pot on the bed of
coals. She poured herself a cup of the strong
brew, trying to get the sleep out of her eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>As she sipped the coffee she heard a horse
pounding across the hard ground. Enid Bradshaw
rode into the firelight, springing from the
saddle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Connie,” she said breathlessly, “there’s going
to be a bad storm, and your cows are sure to run.
I came over to help if you need me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you,” replied Connie coldly, after a
moment of silence. “We don’t need any help.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know how you feel toward me,” Enid said
earnestly. “You think Pop and I have plotted to
ruin you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You did take two of my guests away,” Connie
returned. “But in business and love they say all
is fair.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Connie, you must believe me—I didn’t have
anything to do with it. I never wanted my father
to start the dude ranch in competition with you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I believe you, Enid,” Connie said slowly. “I’m
sure you wouldn’t lie to me. After all, why should
I be offended? Your father has a perfect right to
go into the dude business if he likes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He never wanted to do it either,” Enid went
on desperately. “But we’ve been so hard pressed
for money. The part I can’t forgive is that he
betrayed you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you mean, Enid?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Pop isn’t running the ranch at all now—another
party has gained control—a man who
means to ruin you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The bank?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, Connie—someone you’ve trusted. Pop
will never forgive me for telling, but I must! I
can’t stand by and see you cheated out of everything
you own.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who is it?” Connie demanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Enid did not answer for just at that
moment the very heavens seemed to open. A
vivid streak of lightning zigzagged across the inky
sky, and a torrent of rain descended. Then the
earth trembled, and the sound struck fear to Connie’s
heart. The herd had stampeded!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <br />Stampede</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“The cattle are running!” cried Connie. “The
boys never will be able to hold them in this
storm!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We must get out there and help,” Enid
shouted grimly.</p>

<p class='c008'>This time Connie did not refuse her aid. Before
she could saddle Silvertail, Enid vanished
into the night. Cecil and Helena, awakened by
the sudden downpour, called to Connie, but she
paid no heed. Pulling on her slicker, she leaped
into the saddle and followed Enid.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rain was coming down in torrents and
another brilliant flash of lightning momentarily
revealed a surging mass of steers. The terrified
animals were running away from the camp toward
the canyon. The earth shook under the pounding
of their hooves.</p>

<p class='c008'>All thought of the important revelation which
Enid had been upon the point of making at the
time the storm broke, had been swept from Connie’s
mind. But she felt warmed by the girl’s
generous offer of aid. Enid really was her friend
after all. In this emergency, any feeling of resentment
had been forgotten. The stampede
called for quick action and courageous riding.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie did not need to dig in the rowels of her
spurs for Silvertail knew what was expected of
him. She could feel his mighty heart pounding
against her legs as he raced to overtake the leaders
of the herd.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie bent low over Silvertail’s neck, trusting
that there were no fences or badger holes ahead.
Should her horse stumble she would be badly injured
if not crushed to death.</p>

<p class='c008'>Through the rain the girl saw someone riding
ahead of her. She could not tell who it was, but a
man turned in his saddle and shouted something
at her. She did not distinguish a word above the
roar. Farther away a rider was firing his revolver
into the air, trying to stem the tide.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie, Alkali, and the boys from the Slocer
Ranch outdistanced the leaders of the herd, fighting
valiantly to turn them. The cattle had run
less than a half mile when they began to circle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’re starting to mill!” Connie shouted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll hold ’em!” yelled Alkali.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie could hear the crackling of horns rubbing
together. Each flash of lightning revealed
the cattle churning into a tighter circle.</p>

<p class='c008'>A cowboy rode close to Connie, rain spouting
from his sombrero. She saw that it was Lefty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look out for another break!” he shouted.
“They’re millin’ too close!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly two dark forms dashed out of the
herd.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Get ’em, Silvertail!” Connie cried.</p>

<p class='c008'>She jumped her horse at the animals, sending
them scurrying back into the churning mass.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rain had slackened and Connie was hopeful
that the cattle would quiet down. They were not
milling so closely now. The riders were getting
them well under control.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then from the other side of the herd a revolver
cracked, spitting a trail of fire into the black void.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who did that?” cried Lefty angrily. “Someone’s
shootin’ straight into the herd!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie heard the cowboy shout Cecil’s name,
but she did not believe that any of the dudes had
been responsible for the shot. She was quite certain
neither Helena nor her brother were armed,
and she doubted that they had ridden out to help
stop the herd. One of her own men was trying
deliberately to start another stampede!</p>

<p class='c008'>Already the mischief had been accomplished.
At the point where the revolver had been discharged
the herd swerved and broke apart. The
cattle had started to run again.</p>

<p class='c008'>Determined to learn the identity of the person
who had started the stampede, Connie spurred
Silvertail. Near the spot where the revolver had
been fired she caught a glimpse of a rider. It was
too dark to see his face clearly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then a ragged streak of lightning brightened
the sky. With a start Connie recognized her foreman,
Forest Blakeman. She could not believe
that he had been guilty of such a low, contemptible
act. But even as she was assailed with doubt, she
saw him raise his revolver and shoot again—straight
into the herd.</p>

<p class='c008'>A great fury took possession of Connie. In a
flash everything became clear to her. She understood
now what Enid had intended to tell her.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the very first Forest Blakeman had
plotted to gain control of Rainbow Ranch. That
was why he had not favored the roundup, knowing
that if she succeeded in marketing her cattle,
he would never be able to force her to sell at his
own terms.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How stupid and blind I have been,” she
thought.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie rushed her horse straight at the foreman.
He turned in the saddle and saw her coming.
As a flash of lightning illuminated the sky,
she knew that he recognized her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Drop that gun!” she shouted furiously.
“Drop it, you traitor!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Blakeman wheeled his horse and disappeared
into the darkness.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie did not pursue him. She could not have
done it had she wished for Silvertail was running
with the herd. A shiver ran down the girl’s spine
as the realization came to her that they were heading
straight toward the canyon.</p>

<p class='c008'>At this particular point the cliffs were unprotected
by fences or trees. And there was a sheer
drop of several hundred feet to the valley below.
The canyon could not be more than a quarter of a
mile away. Blakeman deliberately had stampeded
the cattle in that direction, hoping that the animals
would run over the precipice and be killed.
Unless she could turn them in time, her entire
herd would be lost!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIX' class='c009'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <br />Turning the Herd</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Connie leaned low in the saddle and rode as
she had never ridden before. But terror
held her in its grip. Time was so short—the
cliffs so near.</p>

<p class='c008'>A frenzy took possession of the girl. Everything
she had in the world was at stake. If the
herd went over the precipice she would lose every
animal and her last chance to save Rainbow
Ranch. She <i>had</i> to turn the herd even at the risk
of her own life.</p>

<p class='c008'>Silvertail was racing alongside the leaders now,
but they would not swerve. On they ran straight
toward the cliffs with the herd thundering behind.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frantically Connie tore off her slicker as she
rode. Folding it, she used it to strike at the
leaders. Time after time she brought it down on
the rumps of the Longhorns, trying to swerve
them to the right.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie’s heart pounded from the exertion and
her breath came in gasps, but still she struck out
with all her strength. The cliffs were very close
now.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was no use, Connie thought with faltering
courage. They were doomed to go over, she and
Silvertail with the cattle. She could not save
herself by turning back now. The tide of cattle
would sweep them on as surely as if they were
caught in the swift-moving stream of a mighty
river.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the girl became aware of another rider.
Enid too was riding at the head of the herd, discharging
her revolver and fighting desperately to
check the leaders. Alkali and Lefty must be there
too, loyal and true, risking their lives to help her.</p>

<p class='c008'>New courage and strength came to Connie. A
touch of her spurs sent Silvertail leaping after a
rangy Longhorn at the very head of the herd.</p>

<p class='c008'>With all her might Connie brought the slicker
across the animal’s face. He whirled to the right
and the herd followed. Keeping Silvertail between
the frantic animals and the dark precipice
Connie uttered a little prayer. She hoped fervently
that the cattle would turn at a sharp enough
angle to avoid the cliff. A flash of lightning
showed that her horse was running not more than
thirty feet parallel to the brink.</p>

<p class='c008'>As they raced along Connie felt the herd edging
sideways toward the precipice, slowly pressing her
mount closer and closer to destruction. Desperately
she spurred Silvertail alongside the leading
steer and slashed with her slicker at the animal’s
head. The steer swerved in the opposite
direction carrying his blind followers clear of the
brink. Connie’s heart leaped. She had won!</p>

<p class='c008'>Although the danger was past, the work was by
no means done. It took a half hour of hard riding
before the animals could be halted in their mad
run. But at last they were milling again so that
the cowboys could hold them by riding slowly
around the herd.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not until then did Connie have an opportunity
to speak with Enid.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You were wonderful,” she told the girl. “I’ll
never forget it—never. You risked your life to
save my cattle.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I did no more than Lefty or Alkali or any
of the boys,” Enid answered quietly. “Besides, I
owe you a great deal, Connie. I must tell you
about Forest Blakeman. He has deliberately
plotted to ruin you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know,” Connie responded. “I learned the
truth tonight when I saw him shoot into the herd.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then he was the one who stampeded the cattle!
What a criminal thing to do! But it is in keeping
with his character.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell me everything you know about Blakeman,”
Connie urged.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Months ago he loaned my father money, and
he has made trouble for us ever since. At the time
of the rodeo he forced him to keep Catapult out
of the show, expecting to win a large sum of money
for himself. But something went wrong——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know about that,” Connie nodded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pop didn’t wish to deceive his friends but he
had no choice. Oh, Connie, that was why I felt so
ashamed to face you. I suspected too that Blakeman
intended to ruin you, but I couldn’t tell you
without exposing Pop’s part in the affair.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Substituting another steer for Catapult wasn’t
such a terribly serious thing, Enid,” Connie said
kindly. “Please don’t take it so hard.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s more to it than that. After the rodeo
Blakeman came to our ranch and threatened my
father. He made him do exactly what he said.
Pop didn’t want to start a dude ranch to rival
yours. Blakeman arranged to have Miss Parker
and her friend come to our place too. He wanted
you to fail in your enterprise.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I realize that now,” Connie said bitterly.
“Only a miracle saved me tonight. But why has
Blakeman done all these things to me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because he’s grasping and cruel,” Enid replied.
“Dude ranching is going to develop into
a big thing out here, and your place is the cream
of the lot. You have natural scenery and the cliff
dwellings will draw a great many guests. Once
you get started your business will grow by leaps.
Blakeman has known that, and he’s been determined
to gain control for himself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m glad you came to tell me all this, Enid.
It’s cleared up so much misunderstanding.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you’ll forgive Pop and me?” the girl
asked eagerly. “In our hearts we’ve wished you
only success.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I forgive you,” Connie returned
heartily. “And now I have something disagreeable
to do. I must find Blakeman.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie knew that the foreman had disappeared
immediately after he had fired into the herd. Undoubtedly
aware that she had recognized him, he
had fled from the scene. He might have gone
back to the ranch house to pack up his belongings.
If she rode hard she might intercept him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie did not say anything to Alkali or Lefty
for they were busy with the cattle. But as she
started away, Enid rode after her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m going along, Connie,” she declared. “It’s
not safe for you to face Blakeman alone. You
don’t know that man as I do. He might try anything.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I imagine he’s skipped out by this time,” Connie
replied. “But let’s see if we can catch him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The first rays of the morning sun were coloring
the East as they rode across the range toward the
ranch. When they were still some distance away,
Connie drew rein and her companion likewise
halted. They both had observed a lone horseman
leaving Rainbow Ranch.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That looks like Blakeman,” Connie said.
“He’s riding off now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But he’s not going toward Red Gulch,” returned
Enid. “He’s heading for the canyon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on,” Connie urged, “we mustn’t let him
get away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls raced their tired steeds on toward the
horseman. Apparently he did not observe their
approach for he was traveling in the opposite direction
and they were a long distance away.
Blakeman was riding hard too, and they could not
gain.</p>

<p class='c008'>Presently they saw the man disappear down
into the canyon.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Enid, I believe he’s taking the South trail
toward the cliff dwellings!” Connie exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe we ought to let him go. We’ll never
catch him now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, we will,” insisted Connie stubbornly.
“He’ll not be able to travel very fast down in the
canyon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Minutes later, their ponies breathing hard, the
girls reached the top of the canyon. Mounting the
other side they could see Forest Blakeman.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s going straight to the cliff dwellings!”
Connie exclaimed. “I wonder why——”</p>

<p class='c008'>She sprang from her horse, tying him to a tree.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re giving up the pursuit, Connie?” asked
Enid in surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, but I’d rather Blakeman wouldn’t know
we’re following him. He’s up to something, Enid,
and I intend to learn what it is. I know a short-cut
to the other side but the trail isn’t wide enough for
our horses.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Enid slid from the saddle and quickly tied her
pony beside Silvertail. Then Connie led the way
down the trail. Whenever they were within view
of Blakeman they took care to bend low behind the
bushes which overhung the path. The caution was
unnecessary. The foreman never glanced back.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s making straight for the cliff dwellings
all right,” Connie observed a few minutes later.
“We’ll take this fork in the trail and circle, coming
in from the other direction.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls lost sight of the man as he disappeared
behind a wall of rock. Their own trail wound
deeper into the canyon, past a spring which in
days gone by had provided water for the cliff
dwellers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re following the path actually used by the
women of the tribe when they came for water,”
Connie explained as the girls hurried along. “This
is the shortest route to the cliff house, but it’s a hard
climb.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They had gone only a few steps, when in turning
a sharp bend, Connie came to an abrupt halt.
Tied to a pine tree on the slope was a pinto pony.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s not a horse from Rainbow Ranch!”
Enid exclaimed in surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” answered Connie, staring at the pony.
“I never saw it before. It couldn’t have been left
here by Blakeman because he’s on the other trail.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls looked quickly about but they saw no
sign of a rider. Hastening on again, they climbed
a rocky path toward the high cliffs. As they drew
closer, they approached cautiously, keeping an
alert watch for Forest Blakeman.</p>

<p class='c008'>Presently they saw his horse tied up at the same
point where Connie, Cecil and Helena had left
their steeds the previous night, but the foreman
had vanished.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He must be somewhere in the cave back under
the cliff,” Connie whispered. “Perhaps down in
one of the <i>kivas</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But what could he be doing down there?” Enid
asked blankly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s get closer and see if we can find out,”
Connie urged.</p>

<p class='c008'>They followed the trail upward, coming to a
tunnel so narrow that they had trouble in squeezing
through on hands and knees. Emerging at
the end, Connie and Enid stepped out on a wide
shelf. Just ahead were the ruined dwellings, built
snugly under the lip of the cliff.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look!” whispered Connie.</p>

<p class='c008'>She pointed toward one of the <i>kivas</i> at the far
end of the shelf upon which they stood. A crude
ladder leading down into the hole wiggled slightly
as if someone were climbing on it. Then Forest
Blakeman’s head and shoulders appeared.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although the girls were unsheltered he did not
see them immediately. That was because he was
engrossed in examining something in his hand.
Connie saw that it was a roll of bills. As he put the
money into his pocket she and Enid ran forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just a minute, Forest Blakeman!”</p>

<p class='c008'>At the sound of Connie’s voice, the foreman
whirled around to face the girls. A look of fear
gave way to one of insolent defiance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well?” he asked brazenly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have a great many things to explain,
Forest Blakeman,” said Connie grimly. “First,
why did you stampede my herd?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The man laughed harshly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why did I stampede your herd?” he mocked.
“I’d advise you not to make rash accusations without
proof.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have it and that’s why you tried to get away!”
Connie cried. “And another thing—where did
you get that roll of money which I saw you counting?
You had it cached in the <i>kiva</i> and it’s my
money! Money that you stole from me that night
at Eagle Pass!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re crazy,” muttered Blakeman, but his
expression disclosed that Connie’s accusation had
been a true one.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You were the one who held me up,” Connie
cried with conviction. “You’ve kept the money
hidden here in the <i>kiva</i>, and that’s why you never
wanted anyone to come near this place. Give me
my money!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Blakeman started to retreat. Connie and Enid
followed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Give me my money,” Connie repeated again.
“If you don’t——”</p>

<p class='c008'>The foreman whirled around.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll give you something else,” he shouted
angrily. “When you strike the bottom of the
canyon you’ll not be apt to carry any tales!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He hurled himself toward the girls. Enid gave
a piercing scream. Whether or not the man intended
to push them off the narrow ledge the girls
never knew for before he could touch them a cool
voice rang out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stand where you are, Forest Blakeman. And
reach for the sky!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Wheeling around, Enid and Connie saw Jim
Barrows leap nimbly down from the rocks, his gun
trained on the foreman.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXX' class='c009'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <br />The End of the Trail</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The foreman slowly raised his hands above
his head. Jim Barrows frisked him of his revolver
and took possession of the roll of bills
which he tossed over to Connie. She quickly
counted the sum.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s exactly seven hundred dollars here,”
she reported. “Just fifty less than I lost.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I reckon Kerrigan spent the fifty,” said Jim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What did you call me?” demanded the foreman
savagely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jack Kerrigan—wanted in Texas for cattle
stealing and on a few other charges. You’ve
eluded the authorities very cleverly, Jack, but the
law has caught up with you at last.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you a government man?” Connie gasped.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Reckon I am, Miss,” the man agreed, without
taking his gaze from the foreman. “Keep your
hands up, Jack, and don’t try any monkey business.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t understand at all,” murmured Connie
in bewilderment. “I thought——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just what I hoped you would,” finished the
detective. “If you had suspected who I was my
entire purpose would have been defeated. I’ll explain
everything after I’ve taken this hombre to
jail. March on down the trail, Jack!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie and Enid, still somewhat dazed by what
had happened, followed the two men. Barrows
compelled the foreman to ride ahead of him down
the trail while he kept him covered. The girls had
a dozen questions which they wished to ask, but the
detective seemed in no mood for explanations. He
promised them he would return to Rainbow
Ranch just as soon as he had delivered his prisoner
to the sheriff at Red Gulch.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m hopelessly mixed now,” Connie confided
to Enid after they had parted company with the
detective. “To think that I believed Jim Barrows
might have been the one who robbed me of my
money!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t wonder you arrived at such a conclusion,”
Enid replied after she had heard of the
various evidence which had come into her friend’s
possession. “So many things aren’t explained
even now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But the girls did not have long to wait until all
of their questions were answered. By the time
they had changed into dry clothing and refreshed
themselves with breakfast, Jim Barrows returned
to the ranch.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll start at the beginning,” he declared.
“First of all my name isn’t Jim Barrows. Instead
it is Jim Ragon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So that accounts for the initialed handkerchief
which I picked up,” Connie commented.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, and I suppose you’ve guessed that I came
here for the deliberate purpose of getting a job.
I had been tipped off that Blakeman might be the
man I was after.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You weren’t sick at all that day I found you
on the trail?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m afraid I was playing possum. I thought I
might appeal to your sympathy if you thought I
was down and out. So I waited for you on the
trail. It was a mean advantage to take, but it did
serve my purpose. You were kind enough to
give me a job.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Blakeman was suspicious of you from the very
first.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He didn’t like me,” the detective admitted,
“but until today I am sure he did not suspect who
I was. You understand now why I was trying to
break into his chest?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You were after evidence.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, and I did succeed in getting a paper which
definitely links your foreman with a crime committed
in Texas. I could have arrested him yesterday
but by waiting I hoped to learn more.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you think that he was the person who
robbed me at Eagle Pass?” Connie questioned.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I felt certain of it. I thought that by
keeping watch of him I might learn where he had
cached the money.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Connie took a silver knife from her pocket, offering
it to the detective.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here is something which belongs to you, I
believe.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where did you find it?” he asked quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I picked it up last night on the trail to the cliff
dwellings.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must have dropped it when I followed your
foreman there,” the detective responded. “I’ve
been watching him ever since I started working
here at the ranch. Finally I figured out that his
secret trips to the cliffs must have some significance.
Last night I searched the <i>kivas</i> without
success. Today I lay in wait for Blakeman, as
you know, with better luck.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What will happen to him?” Connie asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>The detective shrugged.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, he’ll probably get twenty years if he
pleads guilty. I have him locked up at the jail
now. Late this afternoon I’m starting back to
Texas with him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then I may not see you again,” Connie said
regretfully. “You must forgive me for discharging
you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You did me a service,” the man smiled. “The
only thing I worried about was that you might
tell Blakeman I had been prying into his chest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll always be grateful to you,” Connie said
earnestly. “And you’ll be remembered as the
finest hand I ever had!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe you’ll see me again next summer,” the
man promised as he prepared to ride away. “I’ve
taken a liking to this ranch. I’d enjoy spending
my vacation here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll be looking for you back next year,” Connie
declared.</p>

<p class='c008'>Later in the morning the girls rode to Red
Gulch themselves. By that time the cowboys had
driven the cattle to the stockyards, and the loading
was nearly completed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did we lose many animals in the stampede?”
Connie asked Lefty anxiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Only two,” he answered. “You’re a-sittin’
pretty now, Connie. This shipment ought to net
you a nice amount.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll not need very much of the money to pay
off my bank debt,” she told him gaily. “With the
seven hundred dollars I already have, I’ll make a
first payment on the note. Then as soon as my
check comes back for this stock, I’ll settle it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Looks like you’ll get a good market for your
cattle too,” Lefty declared. “You ought to have
quite a bit left over.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can use it,” laughed Connie. “Oh, I have
wonderful plans! I’ll remodel, and I’ll buy
thoroughbred stock. Perhaps I’ll build a new
wing on the ranch house and advertise for dudes!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Going into the business strong?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s right,” Connie agreed. “This morning
Mr. Grimes said he intends to come back next
year bringing Cecil and Helena. And he knows
several other people he expects to interest in our
place.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I could do without Cecil myself,” Lefty muttered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, he’s improving every day,” Connie
laughed. “In another year perhaps you’ll make
a real cowboy of him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wranglin’ dudes ain’t my favorite pastime.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, that reminds me. Lefty, you’re to have a
new job—and if we do well, a new salary to go
with it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What doin’?” the cowboy asked cautiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re to be the new foreman.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lefty stared at Connie as if he could not believe
his ears. His mouth widened in a grin.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s sure swell of you, Connie. I—I don’t
know what to say.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His horny hand reached out and grasped hers.</p>

<p class='c008'>After leaving the stockyards, Connie went directly
to the First National Bank. Mr. Haynes
received her with a cordiality which was amusing
to the girl. He gave her a receipt for the seven
hundred dollars, assuring her that she need not
worry about the remaining amount.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you,” said Connie, “but I’ll pay off the
rest of my debt in three days.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And she was able to keep her word. The sale
of the cattle netted far more than the girl had
expected. Upon receiving the check in payment,
her first act was to settle the note with the bank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Rainbow Ranch is really mine again,” Connie
thought with satisfaction as she rode slowly
home.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her gaze wandered toward the vermilion cliffs.
She had never seen them quite so beautiful as they
were at this moment, tinted by the last rays of
the afternoon sun.</p>

<p class='c008'>Behind her sloped the golden plain. Ahead in
majestic splendor rose the painted mountains.
Connie drew rein to gaze for a moment at the
familiar scene. Then with a gay laugh she
spurred Silvertail into a brisk canter and they
raced home to Rainbow Ranch.</p>
